# This script does the bare minimum in the source tree to enable other things to happen.
# It is usually internally called when anything big and generitc happens like
# install-packages, install-prerequisites, build-opencpi, etc.
# But it might be called directly to enable other scripts to be run before/without doing
# any of the above.
# It is only callable from the top level of the source tree.
# This sourced script is for clean environments, only for use in the core source tree,
# although if CDK is available we let it go with a warning
if test ! -d exports; then
  # We're being run in an uninitialized environment.
  if test ! -x ./scripts/export-framework.sh; then
    echo Error: it appears that this script is not being run at the top level of the OpenCPI source tree.
    exit 1
