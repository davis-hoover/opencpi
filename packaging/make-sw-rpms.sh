# This script creates software RPMs for the specified platform ($1) and package ($2)
# Since the runtime and devel packages are in one spec file and created together
# this really means if the package ($2) is "driver" it creates the driver RPM, otherwise
# it creates both the runtime and devel RPMs

# It is called by the top level Makefile with arguments for naming package files.

# It first determines the "Requires" aspects for the RPM, and then calls rpmbuild
# The "Requires" for the driver RPM are in that spec file (for now).
