# This script produces a contents list for one of the distribution packages
# It contains the rules for the contents in each one.
# The output is processed by various packaging systems, including rpm and tar
#
# The choices are:
# all:     everything in exports and everything in projects in the git repo
# runtime: minimal runtime (plus some tests) for the platform(s)
# devel:   development configuration minus runtime
# deploy:  runtime with redundant non-platform-specific files
#
# Basically we generate a set of directories and files for export that are
# minimal for the export type.

# The inputs are the type of export (arg1), platforms (arg2), and cross (arg3)
# The third arg is just an empty/non-type boolean indicator

# The result is a set of directories and files, one per line.
# each line is of the form
# <source-path> [<dest-path>]

# Much like the "ls -F" command:
# If there is a @ at the end, it indicates a symlink that should REMAIN linked in destination
# If there is a / at the end, it indicates a directory that should be owned by the package
# I.e. the "devel" package might have files in directories that are owned by the runtime package.
