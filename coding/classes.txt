Ordering of declarations/definitions within classes, and their naming conventions is:

all names with prefixes are initial-lower-camelcase after the prefixes.
class name camel case initial capitalized
types: camel case initial capitalized
constants: - upper case or c_
data members: - using m_
static member data: using s_
static member functions
constructors
destructors
private "init" methods (code shared among constructors)
private member functions
protected member functions
public member functions
-- member accessors set/getters first
static member functions sometimes belong next to something else, rather than
together before the contructors.
