Unused argument warnings in C++ should be addressed by using /* */ commands around the
argument names rather then inserting the C-style "(void)arg" syntax.
There are two types of warnings that we accomodate (meaning we change the code) primarily
because the GCC gods decided that too many people make these mistakes.
- Warnings that suggest extra parentheses for && vs. || are accomodated and extra (unnecessary) braces
  are added under the assumption that no one knows that && is higher precedence than ||.
- Warnings that suggest extra braces for if and else are similar - we add the unnecessary braces
  because not everyone uses editors that indent code properly
The warnings that the result of pointer subtraction is not size_t are dealt with by using the
OCPI_SIZE_T_DIFF macro to make it clear that you are subtracting pointers expecting a non-negative
result.
