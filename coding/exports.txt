In OpenCPI, the term "exports" is used in several places to indicate which files are necessary to expose,
in order for something to be *used*.  I.e. every OpenCPI asset consists of a number of source files,
and if/when built, results in lots of generated output files.  The "exports" of the asset is the subset
of all these files that are needed to "use" the asset.  This concept of "usage" is a post-build usage --
a user of an asset doesn't built it, but expects it to be built in order to be used.

This is basically a typical "information hiding" or "need to know" principle: the owner/implementer of something
decides which files to export (expose to users) and which to not expose.  Not exposing files means they can
change without affecting how users use the asset.

OpenCPI has builtin rules about what gets exported for each type of asset.  Thus there is no a burden on
developers to make such decisions.

Exporting is implemented largely using symbolic links in "exports trees".  I.e. there is a directory
structure populated with symbolic links to exported files.  So an exports tree serves two purposes:
- it identifies the subset of files needed for usage
- it structures the files in a tree structure as they should be used

An exports tree can be converted into a usable standalone directory structure by simply copying it
with the "follow links" option.  This converts the exports-tree-full-of-symbolic-links to a directory structure
consisting of the exported files ready to be used.  If everything is set up correctly, this deep-copy
of an exports tree can be used to use the asset, without the presence of the original source tree or built files
for the asset being used.  The export tree can be seen as a "view" into the built source tree which only contains
files needed for usage, and structured for users of assets, not developers of assets.

Exports trees are populated incrementally, as assets are built, and built for various targets and platforms.
Thus if the assets are built for one platform, the exports tree for the asset will have the files necessary
for using the asset with that platform.  If later, more targets are built, then the exports tree is
further populated with files for that target.  Exports trees enable use for multiple platforms simultaneously.


Exporting happens at three levels:
1. within a project (where one asset uses another in the same project)
2. between projects (where assets in one project use assets in another project)
3. at the level of the OpenCPI framework as a whole

1. exports within a project to enable one asset in a project to use another asset in the project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The lowest level of exporting happens mostly in "lib" directories.  I.e.  a "lib" directory is a directory
containing links and files necessary to use assets, from other assets in the same project.
Wherever you see a "lib" directory in an OpenCPI project, it represents the export tree for one or more assets.

These intra project export trees are all called "lib", and currently exist in three place in a project:

For any component library, a lib subdirectory is the export tree for everything in that library.  This might be
any of:

components/lib - when there is only the one component library called "components"
components/<complib1>/lib - when there are component libraries inside the "components" directory
hdl/{cards,slots,devices,adapters}/lib - these are device-oriented component libraries, lib is the exports
hdl/platforms/<platform>/devices/lib - the exports tree of a platform-specific devices library

For an HDL or RCC platform:

{rcc,hdl}/platforms/<platform>/lib -  the exports tree of the HDL platform itself (not really a library)
Platforms explicitly declare their exports in a <platform>.exports file.

For HDL primitives

hdl/primitives/lib - all the primitive libraries and cores under hdl/primitives are exported here

Finally, there is a project directory called "artifacts", which exposes built OpenCPI artifact files
as a group to be used by unit tests and applications in the project.


2. project exports:  how a project lets other projects use its assets
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a project identifies another project in its "ProjectDependencies" list, it is saying that it uses
that other project's assets, and in fact it is using a project-level exports tree from that project.
This means that the project is only seeing the files exported by that other project, not any arbitrary
file in that other project.

So for a project's assets to be used from outside the project, it must create an exports tree for the
project as a whole.  This is done automatically when a project is built.  As mentioned earlier,
the exports tree for a project is populated incrementally, and supports simultaneous use of the assets
built for different platforms.

The exports tree for a project is the top-level directory called "exports".

This exports tree usually has symbolic links in it that point into the exports trees inside the project.
Thus it is exporting outside the project some subset of what is exported inside the project.

While exports within a project are automatic (except for platform assets which have an explicit exports file),
exports from a project are all explicit.  Nothing inside the project is exported outside the project
except what is specified in the Project.exports file for the project.  However, it is commoon for projects
to have one line in this file containing "all", which indicates that all assets in the project can be
used from outside the project, and that the exports tree for the project should be generated to enable that.

3. framework exports
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The OpenCPI source tree has a variety of files as well as a set of builtin projects.

There is a top-level Framework.exports (was Project.exports) file that specifies exports for the framework
as a whole, and the exports tree generated from this file is the basis for binary packaged distributions
for OpenCPI.  This exports tree indicates everything that may be distributed in any non-source
binary distributions of OpenCPI.  As with other exports trees, it contains all the platforms that
have been built and can be used simultaneously for multiple platforms.

This exports tree is populated based on the following distinct phases, each of which rely on
previous ones.

1. early in the first build process on a fresh source tree, a static/permanent read-only exports tree
is used.  This is the "bootstrap" directory in the root of the source tree.

2. in a fresh source tree the exports tree is initially populated  with files that do not depend on building,
e.g. the scripts that actually perform building, but nothing that is compiled

3. when the framework sources are built for a development host, all the tools and runtime software that are built
are populated in the exports tree for that development host.  The same tree may be built for multiple development
hosts and used by them (presumably with shared network mounts).

4. when the framework sources are cross-built for an embedded RCC platform, all the tools and runtime software
are populated in the framework exports tree.  While the RCC platform lives in a project, and is exported from
that project, it is used to cross-build the framework itself (which is not a project).
Thus what is exported at the framework level is a combination of files resulting from building the framework,
and files exported from the platform itself.

5. when an HDL platform in a project is built, it has its own exports within the project, and also is usually
exported from that project.  The platform's exports may also be used to populate the framework exports tree with
some files needed to create SD cards (bootable media) that combines files from two platforms
(RCC and HDL) that may be from different projects.

So in the framework exports tree a platform may appear in several places for different purposes:

<platform>/        - exports for a platform for use during development
runtime/<platform> - exports for a platform used when executing on that platform, with this tree on a server
deploy/<platform>  - exports staged here to enable creation of SD cards later.

How exports relate to binary distributions:
====================================================================================================

Installing binary distributions can largely be thought of as recreating an exports tree (but without links).

For dev and cross-built software platforms, this is exactly what happens.

A source distribution is built and cross-built, resulting in the frameworks exports tree combining
build outputs.  Binary distributions are usually made one platform at a time, and when installed
are essentially reconstructing the same contents that were in the exports tree.

Beyond the exports tree reconstruction, the following additional top-level entities are in the installation:

- project-repository directory - containing pointers to the builtin-projects
- projects/* - the built-in projects in source form
- userenv.sh - for customizing the installation's user environment
- system.xml - for customizing the OpenCPI system configuration for the dev host itself
- cdk - the exports tree(s)

Binary distributions are not made for HDL platforms (yet).  Mostly this is due to users having
different versions of tools to satisfy various policies and constraints in their organization,
thus prebuilt projects would never satisfy all users.

Export scripts to implement exports
===================================

export-framework.sh    - for source trees to implement framework export trees
                         calls export-platform-to-framework.sh
			 ***only used in a source environment***

export-project.sh - to implement project export trees
                      - exposes intra-project platform export trees as project exports

export-platform.sh    - when a platform is built in its directory in its project, this script performs
                        platform-level exports, usually creating an exports tree under the "lib" directory
		        of the platform.

export-platform-to-framework.sh - populate exports in the framework exports tree for a platform
                                  *** can be used in a binary installation environment for HDL platforms ***
export-utils.sh     - utility functions shared between export-framework.sh and export-platform-to-framework.sh
export-file.sh      - export a file from a project when it is created
Framework.exports   - framework file for framework exports
Project.exports     - project file for project exports in each project
