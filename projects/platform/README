Criteria for content to exist in this OpenCPI project:
* specs/
   - component specs must facilitate generic device worker or platform support
* hdl/primitives/
   - must directly support assets within hdl/devices, hdl/cards, or
     hdl/platforms
* hdl/devices/
   - generic device workers belong here
   - RF ADC/DAC command/control: device proxies must implement the latest
     generation dig_radio_ctrlr component
   - ADC/DAC data flow: de-interleaving/interleaving subdevice workers must
     support the latest generation ADC/DAC data flow paradigm workers
     data_src_adc.hdl/data_sink_dac.hdl
* hdl/cards/
    - device workers for reusable cards belong here
    - reuable card specs belong here
* hdl/platforms/
   - current reference platforms (relatively cheap and supported with high
     priority with as many software and hardware options as possible - e.g. zed,
     ultrascale/ZCU104, etc.)
   - note that non-reference platforms ("full-fledged OSPs") belong in their
     own, separate, OpenCPI project
