PRELIMINARY
This is the initial work for the Cyclone V SOC Kit HDL platform. There is still some work to do 
make this ready for release such as bug fixing in generated code brought to light by using Quartus,
working around the Quartus crash when generating a .sof file, and getting bitstream loading working.

Note that the files copied over from the platform/hdl/primitives/cyclone5 library were patched
so to make sure certain things like device part number and speed grade apply to the cyclone5_sockit.
Other platforms that use cyclone5 would have to do something like this too.
