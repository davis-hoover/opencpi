This is a version of the Zedboard BSP that uses ISE (zed_ise) instead of Vivado (zed).

For setup of the 'zed_ise', follow the Zedboard_Getting_Started_Guide and where appropriate,
substitute 'zed_ise' for 'zed' and ISE for Vivado. (the rest is up to the student!)

When creating an SD card, use the system.xml file located in zed_ise/sd_card. This 
will ensure that the proper container labeling for the FPGA is reported when the 
FPGA not loaded with a bitstream.
