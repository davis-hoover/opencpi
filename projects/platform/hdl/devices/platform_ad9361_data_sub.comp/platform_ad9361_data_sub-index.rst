AD9361 data sub (``platform_ad9361_data_sub``)
==============================================
Defines the build configuration parameters
for the AD9361 data pin interface configurations.
``platform_ad9361_data_sub`` is an asset in the ``ocpi.platform.devices`` component library.
Implementations include the
:ref:`platform_ad9361_data_sub-HDL-worker` (``platform_ad9361_data_sub.hdl``).
Tested platforms include Agilent Zedboard/Analog Devices FMCOMMS2,
Agilent Zedboard/Analog Devices FMCOMMS3, x86/Xilinx ML605/Analog Devices
FMCOMMS2, x86/Xilinx ML605/Analog Devices FMCOMMS3,
Ettus E310 (Vivado only).

Design
------
This component defines the build-time configuration parameter
properties used by the :ref:`platform_ad9361_data_sub-HDL-worker` HDL subdevice worker,
which interfaces with the AD9361 device's ``DATA_CLK_P``/ ``DATA_CLK_N``, ``P0_D[11:0]``,
``P1_D[11:0]``, ``RX_FRAME_P``, ``RX_FRAME_N``, ``TX_FRAME_P``,
``TX_FRAME_N``, ``TXNRX``, and ``ENABLE`` pins.

The ``P0_D`` and ``P1)D`` pins are routed to the HDL subdevice worker
that is appropriate for the given AD9361 data pin interface configuration
(``ad9361_adc_sub.hdl`` or ``ad9361_dac_sub.hdl``; see ``../projects/assets/hdl/devices/``).


A block diagram representation of the implementation is given in :numref:`platform_ad9361_data_sub-diagram`

   Block diagram of AD9361 data sub HDL subdevice worker implementation.

Interface
---------
This component's specification is contained in the OpenCPI Worker Description (OWD) for the HDL subdevice worker.

.. literalinclude:: ../platform_ad9361_data_sub.hdl/platform_ad9361_data_sub.xml
   :language: xml

Ports
~~~~~
  
.. comment out ocpi_documentation_ports directive. It doesn't accept hdldevice.


Opcode handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To be supplied: Description of how the non-stream opcodes are handled (if relevant).


Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

.. don't use ocpi_documentation_properties right now. It doesn't work with hdldevice as the root tag.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~
 
.. can't use ocpi_documentation_properties right now. It only wants componentspec as the root tag.

Implementations
---------------
.. ocpi_documentation_implementations:: ../platform_ad9361_data_sub.hdl

Example application
-------------------
To be supplied: a meaningful example, if relevant to this type of worker.

.. literalinclude:: example_app.xml
   :language: xml

Dependencies
------------
.. not sure I should be listing these assets here.
   
The dependencies on other elements in OpenCPI are:

 * :ref:`platform_ad9361_config_proxy`

 * :ref:`platform_ad9361_config`

 * :ref:`platform_ad9361_spi`


Limitations
-----------
Limitations of ``platform_ad9361_data_sub`` are:

 * None.

Testing
-------
The test outlined in the
`AD9361 DAC <https://opencpi.gitlab.io/releases/develop/docs/assets/AD9361_DAC.pdf>`_
component description (see ``ocpi.assets.devices``)
includes validation of this workerâ€™s functionality (for LVDS mode and CMOS Single Port Full Duplex DDR mode).
