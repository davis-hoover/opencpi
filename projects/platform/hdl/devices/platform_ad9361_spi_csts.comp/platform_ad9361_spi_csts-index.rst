AD9361 SPI CSTS (``platform_ad9361_spi_csts``)
==============================================
Defines properties for implementing an SPI state machine
for communication with the AD9361 integrated circuit.
``platform_ad9361_spi_csts`` is an asset in the ``ocpi.platform.devices`` component library.
Implementations include the
:ref:`platform_ad9361_spi_csts-HDL-worker` (``platform_ad9361_spi_csts.hdl``).
Tested platforms include ML605 (FMC LPC slot), Zedboard (Vivado).


Design
------

.. note::
   This component is functionally equivalent to the AD9361 SPI component except that it specifies the Complex Short Timed Sample (CSTS) protocol in component port definitions instead of the Complex Short With Metadata (CSWM) protocol. The CSTS version of this component will replace the CSWM version in a future release.

This component defines the properties used by the :ref:`platform_ad9361_spi_csts-HDL-worker`,
which implements a serial peripheral interface (SPI) state machine for communication with
the `AD9361 integrated circuit (IC) <https://www.analog.com/en/products/ad9361.html#>`_.

A block diagram representation of the implementation is given in :numref:`platform_ad9361_spi_csts-diagram`

Testing
-------
The test outlined in the `AD9361 DAC <https://opencpi.gitlab.io/releases/develop/docs/assets/AD9361_DAC.pdf>`_ component description (see ``ocpi.assets.devices``) includes validation of a subset of this workerâ€™s functionality.
