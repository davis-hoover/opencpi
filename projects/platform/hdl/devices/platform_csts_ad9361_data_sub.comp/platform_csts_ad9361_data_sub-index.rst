AD9361 CSTS Data Sub (``platform_csts_ad9361_data_sub``)
========================================================
Defines the build configuration parameters
for the AD9361 data pin interface configurations.
``platform_csts_ad9361_data_sub`` is an asset in the ``ocpi.platform.devices`` component library.
Implementations include the
:ref:`platform_csts_ad9361_data_sub-HDL-worker` (``platform_csts_ad9361_data_sub.hdl``).
Tested platforms include Agilent Zedboard/Analog Devices FMCOMMS2,
Agilent Zedboard/Analog Devices FMCOMMS3, x86/Xilinx ML605/Analog Devices
FMCOMMS2, x86/Xilinx ML605/Analog Devices FMCOMMS3,
Ettus E310 (Vivado only).


Design
------
.. note::
   This component is functionally equivalent to the AD9361 Data Sub component except that it specifies the Complex Short Timed Sample (CSTS) protocol in component port definitions instead of the Complex Short With Metadata (CSWM) protocol. The CSTS version of this component will replace the CSWM version in a future release.

This component defines the build-time configuration parameter
properties used by the :ref:`platform_csts_ad9361_data_sub-HDL-worker` HDL subdevice worker,
which interfaces with the AD9361 device's ``DATA_CLK_P``/ ``DATA_CLK_N``, ``P0_D[11:0]``,
``P1_D[11:0]``, ``RX_FRAME_P``, ``RX_FRAME_N``, ``TX_FRAME_P``,
``TX_FRAME_N``, ``TXNRX``, and ``ENABLE`` pins.

The ``P0_D`` and ``P1_D`` pins are routed to the HDL subdevice worker
that is appropriate for the given AD9361 data pin interface configuration
(``ad9361_adc_sub.hdl`` or ``ad9361_dac_sub.hdl``; see ``../projects/assets/hdl/devices/``).


A block diagram representation of the implementation is given in :numref:`platform_csts_ad9361_data_sub-diagram`
