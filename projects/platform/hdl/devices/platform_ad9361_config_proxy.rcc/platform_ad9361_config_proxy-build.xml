<!-- This worker's source code use to have limited logging when ocpi_debug is
     set to false. This logging was changed to be the same regardless of
     ocpi_debug value, but the build configurations were left unchanged:
     1) in order to allow for limited logging in the future, and
     2) to maintain compatibility of applications based on this worker (number
        of build configuration IDs cannot be reduced without breaking
        application compatibility of the OAS instance element's worker
        attribute, which is currently formatted as 'worker-N' for non-zero
        configuration IDs, where N is the build ID [currently
        undocumented/erroneous behavior, ref AV-4904]). -->
