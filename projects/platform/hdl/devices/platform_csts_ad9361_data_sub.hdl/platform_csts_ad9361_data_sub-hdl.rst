``platform_csts_ad9361_data_sub`` HDL Subdevice Worker
======================================================
HDL subdevice worker that interfaces with
the ``DATA_CLK_P``/ ``DATA_CLK_N``, ``P0_D[11:0]``,
``P1_D[11:0]``, ``RX_FRAME_P``, ``RX_FRAME_N``, ``TX_FRAME_P``,
``TX_FRAME_N``, ``TXNRX``, and ``ENABLE`` pins on the AD9361 device.

Detail
------
.. note::
   This HDL subdevice worker is functionally equivalent to the AD9361 Data Sub HDL subdevice worker except that it specifies the Complex Short Timed Sample (CSTS) protocol in port definitions instead of the Complex Short With Metadata (CSWM) protocol. The CSTS version of this worker will replace the CSWM version in a future release.

The AD9361 CSTS  Data Sub is an HDL subdevice worker that interfaces with
the AD9361 device's ``DATA_CLK_P``/ ``DATA_CLK_N``, ``P0_D[11:0]``,
``P1_D[11:0]``, ``RX_FRAME_P``, ``RX_FRAME_N``, ``TX_FRAME_P``,
``TX_FRAME_N``, ``TXNRX``, and ``ENABLE`` pins.
The ``P0_D`` and ``P1_D`` pins are routed to the HDL subdevice worker
that is appropriate for the given AD9361 data pin interface configuration
(``ad9361_adc_sub.hdl`` or ``ad9361_dac_sub.hdl``; see ``$OCPI_ROOT_DIR/projects/assets/hdl/devices/``).

This workerâ€™s ``LVDS_p``, ``HALF_DUPLEX_p``, ``SINGLE_PORT_p``, and ``SWAP_PORTS_p`` build-time
configuration parameter properties
enforce build-time configuration for all of the following AD9361 data pin interface configurations
described in the `Analog Devices AD9361 Reference Manual UG570 <https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1071572/Analog-Devices-Ad9361.html>`_:

* CMOS Single Port Half Duplex
  
* CMOS Single Port Half Duplex Swapped Ports
  
* CMOS Single Port Full Duplex
  
* CMOS Single Port Full Duplex Swapped Ports
  
* CMOS Dual Port Half Duplex
  
* CMOS Dual Port Half Duplex Swapped Ports
  
* CMOS Dual Port Full Duplex
  
* CMOS Dual Port Full Duplex Swapped Ports

* LVDS (Dual Port Full Duplex)
  
Note that the half-duplex data interface formats allow for AD9361 P0/P1 port routing to be runtime-dynamic.

A block diagram representation of the implementation is given in :numref:`platform_csts_ad9361_data_sub-diagram`

   AD9361 CSTS Data Sub HDL Subdevice Worker Block Diagram

Properties are defined as ``<ComponentSpec>`` properties within
the worker's OpenCPI Worker Description (OWD); they are not defined
in a separate OpenCPI Component Specification (OCS).

.. ocpi_documentation_worker::

   dev_data_dac: Interface for data bus that drives configuration-specific AD9361 pins that correspond to the TX data path, and also a signal that drives the output buffer that drives the AD9361 ``TX_FRAME_P`` pin. See the worker's OWD for details.
   dev_data_adc: Interface for data bus driven by configuration-specific AD9361 pins that correspond to the RX data path, and also a signal output of buffer whose input is the AD9361 ``RX_FRAME_p`` pin's signal. See the worker's OWD for details.
   dev_data_clk: Buffered version of the ``AD9361 DATA_CLK_P`` pin.
..   iostandard_is_lvds: Set to ``1`` if the build-time configuration specified LVDS mode; set to ``0`` otherwise.
..   p0_p1_are_swapped: Set to ``1`` if the build-time configuration inverted P0 and P1 data port roles; set to ``0`` otherwise.

Worker Configuration Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because every possible build-time configuration parameter combination of
the AD9361 CSTS Data Sub HDL subdevice worker
has no control plane and no registered data paths, no registers or LUTS
are used and the ``Fmax`` measurement does not exist.


Control Timing and Signals
--------------------------
Because the AD9361 CSTS Data Sub HDL subdevice worker does not include a control plane and serves purely as an IC pin
buffering and routing mechanism, there are no latency or clock domain considerations.
For considerations specific to the RX/TX data paths, see the supports-connected
`AD9361 ADC sub <https://opencpi.gitlab.io/releases/develop/docs/assets/AD9361_ADC_Sub.pdf>`_
and `AD9361 DAC sub <https://opencpi.gitlab.io/releases/develop/docs/assets/AD9361_DAC_Sub.pdf>`_
