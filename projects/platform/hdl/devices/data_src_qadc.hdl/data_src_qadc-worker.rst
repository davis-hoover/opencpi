``data_src_qadc`` HDL device worker
===================================
HDL device worker implementation providing common functionality to all ADC device types.

Detail
------

The data source QADC HDL device worker receives sampled data from an ADC on
its ``dev`` devsignal port.
The worker sign-extends and justifies the samples to 16-bit real, 16-bit complex values,
which is the standard provided by the ``sample`` argument of the
``complex_short_timed_sample-prot`` protocol used by the ``out`` port.
The HDL device worker performs justification within the 16-bit values according to
the value of the ``ADC_INPUT_IS_LSB_OF_OUT_PORT`` parameter property.

The ADC samples are sent along with the ADC clock on the ``dev`` devsignal port.
The ouput port clock is driven by the ADC clock, and backpressure from the output
portâ€™s ready signal is not expected under normal operation. When backpressure is
experienced, the ``overrun_sticky_error`` property is set to ``true``; in this
case, an ``out`` port samples message will be ended if one is in progress, and
a discontinuity message will be sent to the output port.

The ``samp_count_before_irst_samp_drop`` property
gives the number of samples before the first dropped sample and the
``num_dropped_samps`` property gives the number of samples dropped.
Be sure to check these two properties
at the end of an application run because they are not stable until then.
The worker does not use clock domain crossing (cdc) HDL primitive library circuits
for these properties because it takes advantage of the fact that they will have
a stable value by the time the OpenCPI control
plane reads them at the end of an application run.

When set to ``true``, the ``suppress_discontinuity_opcode`` property prevents the HDL device worker from
sending ``discontinuity`` opcodes.
