  <!-- By design, this worker provides control and/or data plane functionality
       that is never intended to be exposed by any other worker. Accordingly,
       this worker defines the ComponentSpec element inside this OWD file, as
       opposed to creating an OCS file including said functionality which could
       be used by other workers. -->

  <!-- Parameters -->

  <!-- This parameter property corresponds to the "LVDS Mode" bit 4 in the parallel port configuration 3
       register at 0x012. -->
  <Property name='LVDS_p' type='bool' parameter='true' default='false'
            description='Use LVDS RX data bus de-interleaving scheme, otherwise use CMOS de-interleaving scheme.
                         Default is CMOS.'/>
  <!-- This parameter property corresponds to the "Half Duplex Mode" bit 3 in the parallel port
       configuration 3 register 0x12 -->
  <Property name='HALF_DUPLEX_p' type='bool' parameter='true' default='false'
            description='Use half duplex mode, otherwise use full duplex mode. Must be false when using LVDS mode.'/> <!-- TODO / FIXME support runtime_dynamic enumeration? -->
  <!-- This parameter property corresponds to the "Single Port Mode" bit 2 in the parallel port
       configuration 3 register 0x12 -->
  <Property name='SINGLE_PORT_p' type='bool' parameter='true' default='false'
            description='Use single port, otherwise use both (dual) ports.  Default is to use both ports. Must be false when using LVDS mode.'/>
  <!-- This parameter property corresponds to the "Single Data Rate" bit 5 in the parallel port

                                      default='DDR'
                                      description='This should have a value of DDR when LVDS_p has a value of true. Either value is acceptable when LVDS_p has a value of false (i.e. CMOS mode is used).'/>

  <!-- Properties -->
  <Property name='channels_are_swapped' type='bool' writable='1' default='false' description="This property exists not as a necessity driven from AD9361 functionality which must be accounted for, but rather as a convenient option to allow control of the routing between the AD9361 pin interface channels (R1 or R2 in the timing diagrams) and this worker's devsignal channels (0 or 1). When this property has a value of true, R1 is routed to channel 0 and R2 to channel 1. When false, the channel relationships are swapped."/>
  <Property name='r1_samps_dropped'    type='bool' volatile='1' writable='1' description="A value of true indicates that one or more samples were sent from AD9361 for its R1 channel (see UG-570 timing diagrams) at a moment in time where no ad9361_adc.hdl worker was assigned to ingest them. A value of true is only possible when an assembly is built with only one ad9361_adc.hdl worker and when this worker's channels_are_swapped property has a value of true, together which is an erroneous condition which should be avoided. The purpose of this property is to be an error check for the aforementioned erroneous condition. Writing a value of false will force the value to false. Writing a value of true will do nothing."/>
  <Property name='r2_samps_dropped'    type='bool' volatile='1' writable='1' description="A value of true indicates that one or more samples were sent from AD9361 for its R2 channel (see UG-570 timing diagrams) at a moment in time where no ad9361_adc.hdl worker was assigned to ingest them. A value of true is possible, for example, when when an assembly is built with only one ad9361_adc.hdl worker and the AD9361 is configured for multichannel mode (2X2), together which is an erroneous condition which should be avoided. The purpose of this property is to be an error check for the aforementioned erroneous condition. Writing a value of false will force the value to false. Writing a value of true will do nothing."/>
