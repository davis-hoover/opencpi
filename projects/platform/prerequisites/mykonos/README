In the no_OS repo:
projects/ad9371/src/devices/mykonos directory is the mykonos library source code.
It uses a "platform" layer found in
projects/ad9371/src/devices/common/common.h
The mykonos code uses these functions:
                 U CMB_hardReset
                 U CMB_hasTimeoutExpired
                 U CMB_setTimeout_ms
                 U CMB_setTimeout_us
                 U CMB_SPIReadByte
                 U CMB_SPIReadField
                 U CMB_SPIWriteByte
                 U CMB_SPIWriteBytes
                 U CMB_SPIWriteField
                 U CMB_wait_ms
                 U CMB_writeToLog
ADI's own low level code for these functions is found in:
projects/ad9371/src/devices/common/common.c

But we will implement them, much like we do for the 9361 in:
projects/platform/hdl/devices/platform_ad9361_config_proxy.rcc/ad9361_platform.cc
