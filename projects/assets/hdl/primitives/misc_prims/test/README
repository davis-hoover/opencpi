# The motivation for these HDL tests is to provide OpenCPI-independent test
# coverage for OpenCPI-independent code in a very-quick-to-build-and-run fashion.
#
# These HDL tests are intended to:
# * build quickly (parallel builds - make -j is expected to work)
# * run quickly (parallel testbenches via make -j, each testbench tests multiple
#                cases simultaneously)
# * run outside of OpenCPI
#
# These HDL tests are NOT intended to:
# * test across multiple simulators, like OpenCPI does (this is xsim only)
# * test OpenCPI-specific code, like OpenCPI does (this is non-OpenCPI tests only)

# Example usage:

pushd /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2017.1/
. ./settings64.sh
popd

make -j 16 -s run
or simply:
make -j 16 -s

# Success Criteria
make run (or simply make) returns an exit status of 0 (regardless of -j -s or any other make options).

# For more info on an individual test's failures, see its README.

# Example cleaning of buildtime and runtime artifacts:
make -j 16 clean
