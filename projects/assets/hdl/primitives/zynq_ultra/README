To see full git history of this directory, use 'git log --follow .'. This primitive was moved from another
project and a plain 'git log' will not show everything.

The source files below basically wrap the ZynqMP UltraScale+ PS multiple times to further abstract away its
low level interface. At the lowest level, we have zynq_ultra_ps_e_v3_2_1.v which is a generated file that
interfaces with the PS8 primitive.

zynq_ultra_ps_e_0.vhd is a generated VHDL file containing the entity and architecture that wraps the PS8
Verilog file for a specific configuration of the PS with certain AXI ports chosen and only the features
needed for OpenCPI.

zynq_ultra_ps_e_0_pkg.vhd is just a VHDL package that contains the component declaration for that VHDL wrapper
entity. This is constructed programmatically from the generated VHO instantiation template.

Finally, zynq_ultra_ps_e.vhd connects that VHDL entity's ports to OpenCPI's AXI primitives, and along with
zynq_ultra_pkg.vhd, exposes those AXI interfaces via the 'zynq_ultra_ps' component in the zynq_ultra VHDL
package.
