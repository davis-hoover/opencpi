To see full git history of this directory, use 'git log --follow .'. This primitive was moved from another
project and a plain 'git log' will not show everything.

The source files below basically wrap the ZynqMP UltraScale+ PS multiple times to further abstract away its
low level interface.

1. zynq_ultra_ps.vhd:
   Our hand-written VHDL module with friendly record-oriented interfaces, based on AXI interface profiles in the
   axi primitive library.  It instances #2
2. zynq_ultra_ps_e_0.vhd:
   A generated VHDL wrapper that wraps the generated Verilog wrapper (#3).
   It stubs out unused interfaces, thus exposing only what we need.  In instanced #3.
3. zynq_ultra_ps_e_v3_3_1_zynq_ultra_ps_e: (note that the version is in the name)
   A generated Verilog wrapper based on the latest version of the IP from Xilinx.
   It makes various width adaptations, and instances the ACTUAL PROCESSOR PRIMITIVE, #4
4. PS8:
   The Xilinx primitive that represents the actual hardware PS.

zynq_ultra_ps_e_0_pkg.vhd is just a generated VHDL package that contains the component declaration for the VHDL
wrapper entity (#2).
