\section{Hardware Prerequisites}
This section describes the hardware prerequisites required for an operational alst4 (Altera Stratix IV) platform using OpenCPI. The optional HSMC Debug Loopback and HSMC Debug Breakout Header cards are only intended for testing purposes. Also note that the slot configurations in Table \ref{table:supported_slots} are limited by what FPGA bitstreams are currently built by OpenCPI and not by what hardware configurations are theoretically possible using OpenCPI.\\ \\
Hardware prerequisites are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item A Stratix IV GX230 board, which has undergone an OpenCPI-specific initial one-time hardware setup \cite{alst4_hardware_setup} and is plugged into a PCIE slot of an x86 computer.
\item Optionally, one of the following HSMC card configurations in Table  \ref{table:supported_slots} may exist
\end{itemize}

\section{Driver Notes}
\input{\snippetpath/Driver_Snippet}

\section{Loading the OpenCPI driver}
When OpenCPI is installed via RPMs, the OpenCPI driver should have been installed. However, when developing with source OpenCPI, the user is required to manage the loading of the OpenCPI driver. \\
The following terminal outputs are intended to provide the user with expected behavior of when the driver is not and is loaded. The user should note that only when the driver is installed can the alst4 be discovered as a valid OpenCPI container.

\begin{lstlisting}
ocpidriver unload
The driver module was successfully unloaded.

ocpidriver load
Found generic reserved DMA memory on the linux boot command line and assuming it is for OpenCPI: [memmap=128M$0x1000000]

\section{Proof of Operation}
The following commands may be run in order to verify correct OpenCPI operation on the x86/Stratix IV system.\\ \\
Existence of alst4 RCC/HDL containers may be verified by running the following command and verifying that similar output is produced.\\
\lstset{language=bash, backgroundcolor=\color{lightgray}, columns=flexible, breaklines=true, prebreak=\textbackslash, basicstyle=\ttfamily, showstringspaces=false,upquote=true, aboveskip=\baselineskip, belowskip=\baselineskip}

ocpirun -C
Available containers:

 1  hdl   alst4                                      PCI:0000:02:00.0
\end{lstlisting}
Operation of the RCC container can be verified by running the hello application via the following command and verifying that identical output is produced. Note that the OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable must be setup to include the hello\_world.rcc built shared object file prior to running this command.
\begin{lstlisting}
ocpirun -t 1 assets/applications/hello.xml
Hello, world
\end{lstlisting}
Simultaneous RCC/HDL container operation can be verified by running the testbias application via the following command and verifying that identical output is produced. Note that the OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable must be setup correctly for your system prior to running this command.\\

\subsection*{Known Issues}
\subsubsection*{JTAG Daemon}
When loading FPGA bitstreams onto the alst4 FPGA (which can occur when running either \code{ocpihdl load} or \code{ocpirun}), multiple issues exists with the Altera jtag daemon which may cause the FPGA loading to fail. The following is an example of the terminal output when this failure occurs:
\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}
The failure may also manifest as a permissions issue:
\begin{lstlisting}

Dump of /tmp/ocpibitstream5904.log:
********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent The follow commands implement a known remedy for each of the aforementioned errors:
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo killall jtagd
sudo chmod 755 /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices
sudo chmod 755 /sys/kernel/debug/usb
sudo chmod 755 /sys/kernel/debug
sudo mount --bind /dev/bus /proc/bus
sudo ln -s /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices /proc/bus/usb/devices
sudo <quartus_directory>/bin/jtagd
sudo <quartus_directory>/bin/jtagconfig
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{Single Port of Data from CPU to FPGA} % AV-3783
\label{bug:3783}
The current implementations of the PCI-e specification on this platform correctly implements data flow from the CPU to the FPGA, only under certain configurations (assembly/container) and is limited to only a single port of data from CPU to FPGA. Fundamentally, OpenCPI only supports a single port connection from the CPU to the FPGA. \\ \\
To ensure the proper configurations are met, assembly and container XML files must be designed based on the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When a single worker exists in an assembly and it ports are connected to the assembly (Externals='true'), then
the container must be built for the "base" container. (i.e. the assembly's Makefile must contain "DefaultContainer=").
\item When an assembly's external connections are explicitly defined (i.e. not using Externals='true'), then the first external assembly connection that is defined in the assembly XML must be that of the CPU to FPGA, and the "base" container used (i.e. the assembly's Makefile must contain "DefaultContainer="), or
\item When defining external connections in a container XML, then the first interconnect container connection defined must be that of the CPU to FPGA and the "base" container used (i.e. the assembly's Makefile must contain "DefaultContainer=").
\end{enumerate}
Note that this applies to the TX/DAC data path connections for bitstreams with transceiver transmit data flow from a CPU (e.g. RCC worker to FPGA TX/DAC data path). See \path{projects/assets/hdl/assemblies/empty/cnt_1rx_1tx_bypassasm_fmcomms_2_3_lpc_LVDS_ml605.xml} as an example.
