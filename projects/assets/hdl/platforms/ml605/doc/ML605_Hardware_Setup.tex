\section{ML605 Hardware Setup}
\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A development system which has Xilinx ISE version 14.7 installed. While OpenCPI has been shown to work with older versions of ISE, these instructions are performed using version 14.7.
	\item Xilinx cable drivers installed. Required for OpenCPI's loadFlash command.
	\item An installed OpenCPI framework from source or RPMs.
	\item The OpenCPI provided projects (core and assets) have been built, by the user, for the \textit{ml605} platform.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Description}
The ML605 is the PCI-Express development board for Virtex 6. It can be purchased directly from Xilinx or a distributor. Xilinx's URL for the board containing user guides and reference manuals can be found here:\par\bigskip
â€‹\url{http://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/ek-v6-ml605-g.html#documentation}\par\bigskip
\noindent  There is one version of the board. The below table contains platform name and part number for the development board.\par\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	\rowcolor{blue}OpenCPI Platform Name & Xilinx Kit Part Number & FPGA Part Number \\
	\hline
	ml605 & EK-V6-ML605-G & XC6VLX240T-1FFG1156 \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}\par\bigskip

\subsection{Setup Overview}
To use this board within OpenCPI, the board must be configured to load the FPGA with an OpenCPI bitstream upon power up. There is flash memory on the board which can be loaded with a bitstream to load the FPGA on power up. The process for loading this flash is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Configure the board to boot from flash memory and the PCIe lane size.
	\item Install board into OpenCPI development host.
	\item Verify JTAG connection using OpenCPI script.
	\item Run OpenCPI loadFlash script.
	\item Verify that the ML605 is configured with a OpenCPI bitstream.
	\item Modification of /opt/opencpi/system.xml.
\end{enumerate}
Details for implementing this procedure can be found in the sections below.

\subsubsection{Configure the board to boot from flash memory and the PCIe lane size}
For more information about configuring the ML605, reference Xilinx ML605 Hardware User Guide, UG534.pdf (v1.8) October 2, 2012.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The S2 DIP switch is a multi-purpose selector switch. It
	controls the state of the FPGA's configuration mode pins and
	must be set for ``Slave SelectMAP Platform Flash XL'' to boot
	from flash memory. Below is a picture of the S2 DIP switch with
	the expected setting:\\ \smallskip
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.20]{ML605_S2.jpg}\par\smallskip
		The table below contains the expected S2 DIP switch
		settings.\par\smallskip
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\rowcolor{blue}S2.1 & S2.2 & S2.3 & S2.4 & S2.5 & S2.6 \\
		\hline
		on & off & off & on & on & don't care \\
		\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}\par\bigskip
	\item The J42 configures the board to support 4x PCIe lanes.
	Below is a picture of J42 with a 100mil shunt installed in the
	correct position.
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{ML605_J42.jpg}\par\bigskip
	\end{center}
\end{enumerate}

\pagebreak
\subsubsection{Install board into OpenCPI development host}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Power off the development host.
	\item Following anti-static best practices, insert the ML605
	into a compatible PCIe slot.
	\item Attach the USB cable between the ML605 JTAG port and a
	host USB port.
	\item With the AUX power supply unplugged (powered OFF), attach
	the AUX power cable to the ML605 AUX power-in connector.
	\item Power ON the AUX power supply by plugging it an A/C
	outlet. (at this point the development host is still OFF)
	\item Locate the SW2 on the ML605, and switch it to the ON
	position, i.e, slide away from the AUX power-in connector. The
	board will power up, but the development host is not powered on.
	\item Power ON the development host.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Verify JTAG connection using OpenCPI script}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open a terminal configured for OpenCPI and run the following script to test the JTAG connection:
	\begin{verbatim}
		$ probeJtag
	\end{verbatim}
	\noindent{\bf Example of the output is shown below:}\smallskip
	\begin{verbatim}
==== Probing for Altera JTAG ports:
Altera directory set by (OCPI_ALTERA_TOOLS_DIR) does not exist.
==== Probing for Xilinx JTAG ports:
Discovered ports are: usb21
Trying port usb21...  ESN is 000013C8121101
Part at position 1 on is xccace
Part at position 2 on is xc6vlx240t.
	\end{verbatim}
For the purposes of this guide, messages related to Altera may be ignored. If the output doesn't look like this, refer Xilinx documentation to ensure the JTAG cable is correctly installed and operational.
\end{enumerate}
\par\smallskip

\subsubsection{Run OpenCPI loadFlash script}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The loadFlash script is located at
	opencpi/exports/centos7/bin/loadFlash for a source installation or
	/opt/opencpi/cdk/centos7/bin/loadFlash for an RPM installation on
	CentOS7 host. Its input arguments are a pre-built ML605 .bitz
	file that is generated by OpenCPI and the serial number (in hex)
	of the JTAG cable from probeJtag script above. Programming the
	flash memory with a bitstream takes approximately 10 minutes to
	complete.\par\smallskip
	\noindent{\bf ML605 syntax}\par
	\noindent\shellcmd{
	loadFlash ml605 <OpenCPI Bitstream File>
	<JTAG\_CABLE\_SERIAL\_NUMBER>}
	\par\smallskip

	\noindent{\bf Example command and output:}\smallskip
	\begin{verbatim}
$ loadFlash ml605 hdl/platforms/ml605/testbias_ml605_base.bitz 000013C8121101

	\end{verbatim}
	\item In the terminal window configured for OpenCPI, execute the
	OpenCPI utility that executes Xilinx iMPACT to scan JTAG for
	devices:\smallskip
	\begin{verbatim}
$ probeJtag

==== Probing for Altera JTAG ports:
Altera directory (set by OCPI_ALTERA_TOOLS_DIR) does not exist.
==== Probing for Xilinx JTAG ports:
Discovered ports are: usb21
Trying port usb21...  ESN is 000013C8121101
Part at position 1 on is xccace
Part at position 2 on is xc6vlx240t
	\end{verbatim}\par\smallskip
	\item Load the OpenCPI driver (requires sudo privileges):\smallskip
	\begin{verbatim}
		$ ocpidriver load
	\end{verbatim}
	\item Execute an OpenCPI utility\smallskip
	\begin{verbatim}
$ ocpihdl search
OpenCPI HDL device found: 'PCI:0000:03:00.0': bitstream date Fri Jun 26 15:14:21 2015,
platform "ml605", part "xc6vlx240t", UUID 8cd0a91e-1c37-11e5-8b5f-f30e2f82978a
	\end{verbatim}
	\item Perform a container check using ocpirun -C. The result
	should look like this:\smallskip
	\begin{verbatim}
$ ocpirun -C
Available containers:
 #  Model Platform    OS     OS Version  Arch   Name
 0  rcc   centos7     linux  c7          x86_64 rcc0
 1  hdl   ml605                                 PCI:0000:03:00.0
  	\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Modification of /opt/opencpi/system.xml}
When multiple boards from same vendor are installed, and thus more than one JTAG USB, the OpenCPI load function (either explicit in ``ocpihdl load'' or implicit in 'ocpirun' needs to know which JTAG USB to use. The '/opt/opencpi/system.xml' file is used to map the PCI:* with JTAG USB serial number information. The '/opt/opencpi/system.xml' is created making a copy of '/opt/opencpi/cdk/default-system.xml' and editing it to reflect the system's PCI to JTAG relationship.
An example is shown below:
	\begin{verbatim}
<opencpi>
    <container>
        <hdl>
        <device name="0000:03:00.0" esn="000013C8121101"/>
        <device name="0000:08:00.0" esn="000013C84C2F01"/>
        </hdl>
    </container>
</opencpi>
	\end{verbatim}
After updating the '/opt/opencpi/system.xml', performing a container check using \textit{ocpirun -C} should show the following results for multiple installed ml605 cards:
	\begin{verbatim}
$ ocpirun -C
Available containers:
 #  Model Platform    OS       OS Version  Arch   Name
 0  rcc   centos7     linux    c7          x86_64 rcc0
 1  hdl   ml605                                   PCI:0000:08:00.0
 2  hdl   ml605                                   PCI:0000:03:00.0
	\end{verbatim}

\end{document}
