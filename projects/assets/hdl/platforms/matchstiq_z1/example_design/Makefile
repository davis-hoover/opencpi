----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The instructions below are used to execute an application on a remote
platform like the Matchstiq-Z1.

There are four steps for executing an application:
1) Build ACI and/or input test data (development system)
2) Setup the OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH (remote system)
3) Execution of application (remote system)
4) Verification of output data (development system)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Build ACI and/or input test data: (development system)
NOTE: Required only if test data has never been built.
OCPI_TARGET_PLATFORM=xilinx13_3 make
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Setup the OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH: (remote system)

NOTE: Reminder to setup the run-time OCPI environment on remote system.
. /mnt/card/opencpi/mynetsetup.sh {DEVELOPMENT HOST IPADDRESS}

NOTE: Convenience cmd to quickly switch to application directory.
cd /mnt/ocpi_assets/hdl/platforms/matchstiq_z1/example_design

REQUIRED - Reconfigure to default.
Copy/paste string to terminal of remote system:
export OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH=$$OCPI_CDK_DIR/$$OCPI_TOOL_PLATFORM/artifacts

REQUIRED - Configure for operation.
Copy/paste string to terminal of remote system:
export OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH+=:$$(pwd):$$(pwd)/../../../../artifacts
NOTE: When copy/paste of the above 'export' from the Makefile source file, the redundant '$' must be manually removed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Execution of application is specific to platform: (remote system)
./target-xilinx13_3/matchstiq_z1_example_design
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Verification of output data: (development system)
./scripts/plotAndFft.py odata/testbench_rx.out complex 300000 1 &
