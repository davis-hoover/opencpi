\subsection{Installation of provided OpenCPI projects: \textit{core} and \textit{assets}}
This guide  assumes the user has executed \textit{ocpi-copy-projects}, accepting the default settings, to copy and register the \textit{core} and \textit{assets} projects from the /opt/opencpi/projects for building bitstreams for the Matchstiq-Z1. Reference the Getting Started Guide for details on \textit{ocpi-copy-projects}.  While registering of the projects is performed during the execution of ocpi-copy-projects, changes to the registry can be made via \code{ocpidev un/register project} or the ANGRYVIPER GUI.\medskip

\begin{verbatim}
$ ocpi-copy-projects
...

$ ls ~/ocpi_projects
assets core
$ ocpidev show registry
Project registry is located at: /opt/opencpi/cdk/../project-registry

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Vendor Software Setup}
The platform that is expected to be used is the Epiq Solutions Matchstiq-Z1 (\textit{e.g.} matchstiq\_z1). This OpenCPI-enabled platform provides the capability of deploying hardware and software workers while using Xilinx's 13.3 distribution of Linux.\\ \bigskip

The synthesizers and cross-compilers required to build HDL and RCC Workers for this platform are installed by following the instructions found in the \textit{OpenCPI FPGA Vendor Tools Installation Guide}. This document assumes that the user has installed the appropriate versions of Vivado and the Xilinx SDK.\\ \bigskip

\subsection{Building OpenCPI projects: \textit{core} and \textit{assets} }
\label{sec:Building OpenCPI projects}
The \textit{core} and \textit{assets} projects must be built \textit{in a specific order} for this platform. This section outlines how to build the relevant projects and provides the commands to do so.\medskip

For this document, the projects should be built as follows:\\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Build \code{core} for the \code{xilinx13\_3} RCC Platform and the \code{matchstiq\_z1} HDL Platform (approx 30 min)
	\item Build \code{assets} for the \code{xilinx13\_3} RCC Platform and the \code{matchstiq\_z1} HDL Platform, but omit assemblies (approx 45 min)
	\item Build the \code{testbias} assembly from the \code{assets} project. This will be used later in this guide. (approx 10 min)
\end{enumerate}
\begin{lstlisting}[showspaces=false]
$ cd /home/<user>/ocpi_projects/
$ ocpidev build -d core     --rcc-platform xilinx13_3 --hdl-platform matchstiq_z1
$ ocpidev build -d assets   --rcc-platform xilinx13_3 --hdl-platform matchstiq_z1 --no-assemblies
$ ocpidev build -d assets hdl assembly testbias       --hdl-platform matchstiq_z1
\end{lstlisting}
Note: replace ``\code{<user>}'' with your username in the commands above.\\\medskip

Each of these build commands can also be performed via the ANGRYVIPER IDE as follows:
\OcpidevBuild
See the ANGRYVIPER Team's Getting Started Guide for additional information concerning the use of \code{ocpidev} and the ANGRYVIPER IDE to build OpenCPI assets.

\subsection{Hardware Setup}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Epiq Solutions Matchstiq-Z1 SDR Kit}\\ \medskip
It is expected that this SDR kit includes a power supply, two SMA/SMB adapters, micro-USB to USB cable, micro-SD card installed internally (expected).

A micro-USB connector on the back of the Matchstiq-Z1 provides access to the serial connection. To expose this micro-USB connector, the two screws in the back plate must be removed.  Historically, this connector's attachment to the PCB has been extremely fragile, \textbf{so be careful when inserting/removing the mating cable}.\\ \medskip

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.08]{Matchstiq_Z1_backpanel}}
	\caption{Connected Back Panel}
	\label{fig:back}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Micro-USB to Ethernet adapter}. To allow network access when plugged into the front panel micro-USB port.  The OpenCPI BSP for the Matchstiq-Z1 is configured for DHCP. An Ethernet connection is required for developing OpenCPI in Network mode.

On the front panel of the Matchstiq-Z1, there are three labeled SMB (50 Ohm) connectors: ``RX'' (receive), ``TX'' (transmit), and ``GPS''.  From the factory, the Matchstiq-Z1 is provided with two SMB to SMA adapters.  Due to the RF performance to the transceiver device, any RF COAX cables should be rated up to at least 3GHz. \\ \medskip
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Matchstiq_Z1_frontpanel}}
	\caption{Connected Front Panel}
	\label{fig:front}
\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Access to a network which supports DHCP. (Network Mode)}
\item \textbf{Micro-SD card, 4GB+ (OPTIONAL, as it is possible to use internally installed card) }
\item \textbf{Micro-SD card reader}
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\newpage
\section{SD Card Setup}
\label{sec:SD_Card_Setup}
The Matchstiq-Z1 SDR is equipped with two SD card slots: one internal and one accessible via the front panel. It is expected that the SDRs are shipped from Epiq Solutions with an SD card installed in the internal slot that is loaded with their embedded environment. A feature of this SDR is that when an SD card is installed in the front panel SD slot, the SDR will automatically choose to operate from this SD card rather than the internal SD card. Therefore, a user can easily switch the SDR between operating in the Epiq Solutions or OpenCPI environment.

The Matchstiq-Z1's factory SD card has a non-default formatting and content, which \textit{must} be maintained for proper operation. This guide assumes that the internal (factory) SD card is being use for OpenCPI and will be reinstalled in the front panel SD card slot. If the user desires the use of a new SD card, the user must ensure that it is initially imaged from the factory provided SD card, as there is a unique partition containing required content from the OEM.

\subsection{Make a backup image of factory SD card (assumes Linux host)}
This section provides the steps for creating an SD card backup image.  Access the internal SD card slot by removing the screws from the front and back plates, then slide the board assembly out of the enclosure. Flip the SD card slot open and lift the card out. Insert the SD card into a USB reader and install into a host machine.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Determine the device file name for the SD card by
	executing dmesg command below. It will likely be something
	like \texttt{/dev/sdb} or \texttt{/dev/mmcblk0}.\\ \\
	\texttt{\$ dmesg | tail -n 15}
	\item Run the following \textit{dd} command to make a backup
	image, where DEVICENAME was determined above. This step
	should take $\sim15$ minutes depending on the card size.\\ \\
	\texttt{\$ dd if=DEVICENAME of=backup.image}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Format the SD card for OpenCPI}
The Matchstiq-Z1 SDR requires an SD card with a
specific partition and content. The recommend method for formatting a new SD card is to begin by imaging the new card using the backup image of the factory SD card, removing factory default files and directory and copying OpenCPI content to SD card.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Format an SD card for OpenCPI, (restore to its original factory default captured in the previous section), run the command \\ \\
	\texttt{\$ dd of=DEVICENAME if=backup.image}
	\item To prepare for OpenCPI provided content to be placed onto the SD card, remove all factory files and directories from the ATLAS partition.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Copy embedded OS files to SD card, ``ATLAS'' partition}
\label{sec:Copy embedded OS to SD card}
\begin{flushleft}

WARNING: The user must ensure that the contents of the SD, match the version of the OpenCPI release that the artifacts were built against.\\ \medskip

Copy the following files/directories into the ``ATLAS'' partition:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cp /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/iveia-atlas-i-z7e.dtb /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/

$ cp /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/u-boot.bin /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/

$ cp /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/uImage /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/

$ cp /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/uramdisk.image.gz /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/
\end{verbatim}

Any files/directories copied to the ``ATLAS'' partition will appear at /mnt/card on the Matchstiq-Z1.\\ \medskip

The need to copy the \textit{/opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq\_z1/opencpi} onto the SD card is dependent on the desired operating mode (Standalone vs Network) and is discussed in the following sections.
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Copy files to SD card for desired Mode(s)}
As previously discussed, Standalone and Network modes offer trade-offs for configuring the run-time environment of the platform. The following sections provide instructions for copying specific files/directories to the SD card in support of these modes. For maximum flexibility and completion of this getting started guide, it is recommended that the SD card be configured to support both modes, as covered in the next sub-section. However, instructions for configuring the SD card for each mode separately, have also been provided.

\subsubsection{Standalone and Network Modes}
The SD can be setup to support both modes, as there is no conflict between the files/directories for either mode. To setup the SD to support both modes:\\

\noindent After performing the steps from \ref{sec:Copy embedded OS to SD card}, copy the entire \textit{opencpi} directory to the SD card.

\begin{verbatim}
$ cp -rL /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/opencpi /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/

$ cp /home/<user>/ocpi_projects/assets/hdl/assemblies/testbias/container-testbias_matchstiq_z1_base/\
target-zynq/testbias_matchstiq_z1_base.bit.gz /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/opencpi/xilinx13_3/artifacts/
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Standalone Mode}
After performing the steps from \ref{sec:Copy embedded OS to SD card}, copy the entire \textit{opencpi} directory to the SD card, then copy the relevant bitstreams, artifacts into the \textit{artifacts} directory and application XMLs into the \textit{applications} directory. For this getting started guide, only one bitstream is required to be copied onto the SD cards, where as the required artifacts and application XML where copied to the SD along with the entire \textit{opencpi} directory.

\begin{verbatim}
$ cp -rL /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/opencpi /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/

$ cp /home/<user>/ocpi_projects/assets/hdl/assemblies/testbias/container-testbias_matchstiq_z1_base/\
target-zynq/testbias_matchstiq_z1_base.bit.gz /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/opencpi/xilinx13_3/artifacts/
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Network Mode}
After performing the steps from \ref{sec:Copy embedded OS to SD card}, create a directory on the partition named ``opencpi'' and copy the following files into the this directory:

\begin{verbatim}
$ mkdir /run/media/<user>/ATLAS/opencpi

$ cp /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/opencpi/system.xml \
/run/media/<user>/ATLAS/opencpi/

$ cp /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/opencpi/default_mynetsetup.sh \
/run/media/<user>/ATLAS/opencpi/

$ cp /opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/sdcard-xilinx13_3/opencpi/zynq_net_setup.sh \
/run/media/<user>/ATLAS/opencpi/
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{SD Card Source}
The final SD Card artifacts are distributed in \path{/opt/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/} via RPM as noted previously. The end user is not required nor expected to generate the files.

\subsection{No changes required for ``SDHOME'' partition}
All the files in this partition can be ignored. If space for files is required for your application, they can be deleted.

\section{Hardware Setup}

\subsection{Establish a Serial Connection}
By default, the USB to Serial adapter connects as read-only, which requires sudo privileges for establishing a serial connection. OpenCPI recognizes that sudo may not be available and has provided an alternative for configuring the device thereby allowing all users access to the device. Specifically, this is accomplished by adding \texttt{udev} rules to instruct the device connection to have read and write permissions for all users.
\begin{itemize}
\item If OpenCPI was installed via RPMs, the \texttt{udev} rules are automatically setup for the user.
\item If OpenCPI was installed from source, then the user must manually add the \texttt{udev} rules by copying the file from the host machine's installation directory to the host machine's \path{/etc/udev/rules.d/}. The following command can be used as a guide:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
$ sudo ln -s /<install-path>/opencpi/cdk/matchstiq_z1/host-udev-rules/97-matchstiq_z1.rules \
97-matchstiq_z1.rules
\end{verbatim}
\item Whether installed via RPMs or source (and manually creating the symbolic link), the USB to Serial adapter will be connected as \texttt{/dev/matchstiq\_z1\_0} with read and write permissions for all users.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Once the Matchstiq-Z1 is powered on, use the following command to connect to the serial port:
\begin{verbatim}
$ screen /dev/matchstiq_z1_0 115200
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Update U-boot Variables}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Remove power from the Matchstiq-Z1 unit.
\item Insert the SD card into the front panel SD card slot.
\item Connect a terminal to the rear micro-USB connector of the Matchstiq-Z1 with a baud rate of 115200.
\begin{itemize}
\item per the previous section, ``\texttt{screen /dev/matchstiq\_z1\_0 115200}'' can be used to connect to the serial port.
\end{itemize}
\item Apply power to the Matchstiq-Z1 with the terminal still connected and stop the boot process by hitting any key to enter the U-Boot terminal.
\item Run the following commands to setup the environment variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{setenv bootcmd \textquotesingle ivmmc; run ocpiboot\textquotesingle}
\item \texttt{setenv ocpiboot \textquotesingle setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200n8 root=/dev/ram rw earlyprintk; \\
setenv fdt\_high ffffffff; setenv initrd\_high 0x1000000; fatload mmc \$\{iv\_mmc\} \$\{dtbaddr\}\\
\$\{dtbfile\}; fatload mmc \$\{iv\_mmc\} \$\{loadaddr\} \$\{bootfile\}; fatload mmc \$\{iv\_mmc\}\\
0x2000000 uramdisk.image.gz; bootm \$\{loadaddr\} 0x2000000 \$\{dtbaddr\}\textquotesingle}
\subitem *Note: This should be a one-line command. Make sure there are no newlines.
\item \texttt{saveenv}
\end{itemize}
\item These U-Boot environment variables are now saved to the second partition of the SD card
\end{enumerate}

\begin{flushleft}
Verify that the changes are correct by running the command ``\texttt{env p}'' and comparing to:

\section{Configuring the run-time environment on the platform}

\subsection{Network Mode}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensure the USB to Ethernet adapter is plugged into the micro-USB port of the front panel and connected to a network configured for DHCP.
\item Ensure a micro-USB to USB cable is connected between the Matchstiq-Z1's serial port and development host.
\item Apply power to the Matchstiq-Z1
\item Use a serial terminal application to establish a serial connection, for example:
\begin{verbatim}
$ screen /dev/matchstiq_z1_0 115200
\end{verbatim} \medskip

\item After a successful boot to PetaLinux, login to the system, using  ``\textbf{root}`` for user name and password.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Matchstiq_Z1_login}}
	\caption{Successful Boot to PetaLinux}
	\label{fig:boot1}
\end{figure}

\item Setup the OpenCPI environment on remote system

\begin{flushleft}
Each time the SDR is booted, the OpenCPI environment must be setup. By sourcing the \texttt{mynetsetup.sh} script, the remote system's environment is configured for OpenCPI and NFS directories are mounted for Network mode.\footnote{This script calls the \texttt{zynq\_net\_setup.sh} script, which should not be modifiable by the user.}. The user must provide the network address of the development system to the script as its only argument:
\begin{verbatim}
$ source /mnt/card/opencpi/mynetsetup.sh XX.XX.XX.XX
\end{verbatim} \medskip

where XX.XX.XX.XX is the IP address of the NFS host (i.e. that development host, \textit{e.g.} 192.168.1.10). A successful run is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:netsetup}.
\end{flushleft}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\label{fig:netsetup}
\end{figure} \medskip

\input{NTP_Alarm_Clock}

\end{enumerate}

\pagebreak
\subsection{Standalone Mode}
All artifacts (.so, .bit.gz) for any applications or tests that need to be located on the SD card must be on the ATLAS partition in the \texttt{opencpi/xilinx13\_3/artifacts} folder.  All of the helper utilities such as \texttt{ocpirun} and \texttt{ocpihdl} are already located on the SD card and do not need to be copied over to the SDR platform.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensure the USB to Ethernet adapter (as needed) is plugged into the micro-USB port of the front panel and connected to a network configured for DHCP. \item Ensure a micro-USB to USB cable is connected between the Matchstiq-Z1's serial port and development host.
\item Apply power to the Matchstiq-Z1
\item Use a serial terminal application to establish a serial connection, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
$ screen /dev/matchstiq_z1_0 115200
\end{verbatim} \medskip

\item After a successful boot to PetaLinux, login to the system, using  ``\textbf{root}`` for user name and password.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Matchstiq_Z1_login}}
	\caption{Successful Boot}
	\label{fig:boot2}
\end{figure}

\item \textcolor{red}{WARNING:}
Applications (including XML-only ones) fail if there is not an IP address assigned to the platform, even when in ``standalone mode.'' When the Ethernet port is not connected to a network configured with DHCP, a temporary IP address must be set:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ifconfig eth0 192.168.244.244
\end{verbatim} \medskip

\item Setup the OpenCPI environment on remote system

Each time the SDR is booted, the OpenCPI environment must be setup. By sourcing the \texttt{mysetup.sh} script, the remote system's environment is configured for OpenCPI.\footnote{This script calls the \texttt{zynq\_setup.sh} script, which should not be modifiable by the user.}. There are no arguments required for this script.
\begin{verbatim}
$ source /mnt/card/opencpi/mysetup.sh

\section{Build an Application}
\begin{flushleft}
The setup of the platform can be verified by running an application that uses both RCC and HDL workers. A simple application that requires two RCC and one HDL worker is located in \texttt{assets/applications/bias.xml}, but only the RCC artifacts are provided with the installation of RPMs, and are availble on the SD card (Standard Mode) or mounted CDK directory (Network Mode). The remaining task is to build an assembly, or bitstream for loading the FPGA, which contains the HDL worker.
\end{flushleft}

\section{Run an Application}
\subsection{Network Mode}
The default setup script sets the \texttt{OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH} variable to include the RCC workers that are required to execute the application, but it must be updated to include to the assembly bitstream that was built.  After running the \texttt{mynetsetup.sh} script, navigate to  \texttt{/mnt/ocpi\_assets/applications}, then update the \texttt{OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH} variable:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd /mnt/net/cdk/applications
$ export OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH=$OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/ocpi_assets/artifacts
\end{verbatim}
Run the application using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ocpirun -v -t 1 -d -m bias=hdl bias.xml
\end{verbatim}
The output should be similar to Figure~\ref{fig:netBias}:
\begin{verbatim}
% ocpirun -v -t 1 -d -m bias=hdl bias.xml
Available containers are:  0: PL:0 [model: hdl os:  platform:
matchstiq_z1], 1: rcc0 [model: rcc os: linux platform: xilinx13_3]

\subsection{Standalone Mode}
\begin{flushleft}
The default setup script sets the \texttt{OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH} variable to include the all of the artifacts that are required to execute the application. Specifically, all three of the artifacts that are located on the SD card are mounted at \texttt{/mnt/card/opencpi/xilinx13\_3/artifacts}.  After running \texttt{mysetup.sh}, navigate to \texttt{/mnt/card/opencpi/applications} and ensure the \texttt{OCPI\_LIBRARY\_PATH} variable is configure as shown below:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd /mnt/card/opencpi/applications
$ export OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH=$OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH:/mnt/card/opencpi/xilinx13_3/artifacts
\end{verbatim}

Run the application using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ocpirun -v -t 1 -d -m bias=hdl bias.xml
\end{verbatim}

\section{Intermittent Errors}
Some tests have had ``Segmentation Faults'' or ``Alignment Errors'' in certain scenarios on the Z1. This seems to happen when both USB ports are used to simultaneously transmit a large amount of data, \textit{e.g.} high log-level output to a USB serial console as well as NFS-mounted output files over a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. The default test setup avoids triggering this by limiting output that is fed to the user, but users should be aware of this issue if non-default test scenarios are attempted. If \texttt{ssh} is used to have all data routed through the USB-to-Ethernet adapter, this failure mode is avoided.
\section{Using ISE instead of Vivado with the Matchstiq-Z1}
It is recommended that you use the default toolset (Xilinx Vivado) to build Matchstiq-Z1 bitstreams with OpenCPI. However, if you wish to use ISE instead, reference the README file in \path{assets/hdl/platforms/matchstiq_z1/ise_constraints/}, and perform the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Modify the target part in \path{assets/hdl/platforms/matchstiq_z1/matchstiq_z1.mk} to use the ISE alias:
\subitem \code{HdlPart\_matchstiq\_z1=xc7z020\_ise\_alias-1-clg484}}
\item{Export the ISE constraints files found in \path{<assets/>hdl/platforms/matchstiq_z1/ise_constraints/} by modifying \code{ExportFiles} variable in \path{assets/hdl/platforms/matchstiq_z1/Makefile}:
\subitem \code{ExportFiles=ise\_constraints/matchstiq\_z1.ucf ise\_constraints/matchstiq\_z1.ut matchstiq\_z1.mk}}
