The use of the matchstiq_z1_gpio_slot is to create a "virtual slot" and so that
different device workers can be connected to the FPGA GPIO pins of the matchstiq_z1.
These "virtual cards" don't go through all possible permutations of gpi and gpo
device workers; they serve as examples. Other permutations can be added as needed
if another one is desired.
The framework does not allow one to parameterize which component is inserted at
build time/parameterizing which worker signals will connect to an FPGA pin.
So this is used as a workaround and is not recommended practice.

The "virtual cards" have these configurations:
 matchstiq_z1_gpi_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = IN/IN/IN
 matchstiq_z1_gpio_in_in_out_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = IN/IN/OUT
 matchstiq_z1_gpio_in_out_in_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = IN/OUT/IN
 matchstiq_z1_gpio_in_out_out_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = IN/OUT/OUT
 matchstiq_z1_gpio_out_in_in_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = OUT/IN/IN
 matchstiq_z1_gpio_out_in_out_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = OUT/IN/OUT
 matchstiq_z1_gpio_out_out_in_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = OUT/OUT/IN
 matchstiq_z1_gpo_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = OUT/OUT/OUT
 matchstiq_z1_gp_out_card.xml - FPGA_GPIO1/2/3 = OUT/OUT/OUT
