\section*{Deprecation Notice:}
Beginning with OpenCPI Version 1.5, support for Lime Microsystems' Zipper card is now deprecated. This document will not be updated any further.
\section*{Limitations: Myriad-RF 1 and Zipper Daughtercard}
The following is a list of the known limitations with OpenCPI and the Myriad-RF 1 and Zipper Daughtercard:\par
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[1)] The Zipper Carrier card is no longer being produced by the manufacturer. The card is Open Source so you are able to fabricate one yourself.
	\item[2)] Sample Rate Limit on ML605, Stratix IV and ZedBoard Rev D
	\item[3)] Clock initialization error with SI5351 proxy RCC component
	\item[4)] Only VADJ supported on ZedBoard is 2.5 V
	\end{itemize}
This document will describe the limitations and any workarounds.
\subsection*{Sample Rate Limitations}
During testing of the OpenCPI reference applications, data fidelity issues have been observed in the following scenarios:
%\begin{flushleft}
%\begin{center}
\begin{table}[H]

		\label{table:samplelimits}
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|X|}
			\hline
			\rowcolor{blue}
			\textbf{Platform} & \textbf{Maximum Sample Rate} \\
			\hline
			ML605 & 34 MS/s\\
			\hline
			Stratix IV & 25 MS/s\\
			\hline
			ZedBoard Rev D & 34 MS/s\\
		    \hline
		\end{tabularx}
		\caption{Sample rate limitations per platform}

		\textit{Note: } ZedBoard Rev C does not show any such limitations. The Matchstiq-Z1 and Picoflexor T6A-S1 do not use use the Zipper daughtercard and therefore do not show any such limitations.
\end{table}

%\end{center}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item ZedBoard Rev D
\noindent As of the 1.2 release of OpenCPI, it is suspected that these upper sampling rate data fidelity problems are caused by phase incoherence due to the non-source-synchronous ADC/DAC clock source on the Zipper that are not being accounted for. This will be investigated during future release(s).
\subsection*{Clock Initialization Error with SI5351 Proxy RCC Component}
When using OpenCPI and the Myriad-RF 1 and Zipper Daughtercard, the SI5351 proxy component experiences the following intermittent errors:\par\medskip
\noindent \code{Exception thrown: Code 0x17, level 0, error: 'Worker 'clock\_gen' produced error during the 'stop' control operation: SI5351 has not completed system initialization'}\par\medskip
\noindent \code{Exception thrown: Code 0x17, level 0, error: 'Worker 'clock\_gen' produced error during the 'initialize' control operation: SI5351 has not completed system initialization'}\par\medskip
\noindent Per an application note of the SI5351\cite{an_619}, this error means that the IC is in 'System Initialization Mode'. It isn't recommended to read or write registers during this period, so the proxy correctly throws an exception. This mode is only supposed to be encountered during power up, but the error occurs intermittently  during use of this platform.\par\medskip
\noindent There is no known workaround for this error. The error does not typically occur multiple times in a row, so re-running the application after an occurrence typically completes successfully.
\subsection*{Only VADJ supported on ZedBoard is 2.5 V}
The ZedBoard platform  and the Myriad-RF 1 and Zipper Daughtercard support three different Vadj voltages for the FMC LPC connector. During testing of the OpenCPI reference applications, the only working configuration was 2.5 V. 3.3 V was not tested and 1.8 V showed data fidelity issues.  It is recommended that 2.5 V be used.
