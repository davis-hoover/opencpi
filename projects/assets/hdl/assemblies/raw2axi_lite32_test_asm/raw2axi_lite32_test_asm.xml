<!-- This is the HDL XML Makefile for assembly: raw2axi_lite32_test_asm
     The file 'axi_test.xml' defines the assembly.
     The default container for all assemblies is one that connects all external ports to
     the devices interconnect to communicate with software workers or other FPGAs.
     Limit this assembly to certain platforms or targets with
     Exclude/Only and Targets/Platforms ie:
        OnlyTargets=
        ExcludeTargets=
        OnlyPlatforms=
        ExcludePlatforms=
     If you want to connect external ports of the assembly to local devices on the platform,
     you must define container XML files, and mention them in a "Containers" variable here, e.g.:
     Containers='take_input_from_local_ADC' -->
<HdlAssembly>
	<instance worker='raw2axi_lite32_tester'/>
</HdlAssembly>
