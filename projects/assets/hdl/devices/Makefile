# All tests created here in *.test directories will be built/run automatically
# To limit the workers that actually get built, set the Workers= variable
# To limit the tests that actually get built/run, set the Tests= variable

# Build Ordering Rules:
# 1) Subdevices that support other devices must occur AFTER the devices they support.
# 2) Similarly, Emulators must occur after the devices they emulate.
