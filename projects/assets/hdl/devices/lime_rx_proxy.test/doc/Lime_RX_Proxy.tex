\section*{Functionality}
This control proxy is designed to allow the user of the proxy to set more user friendly properties than the register map on the LMS6002D Transceiver.  Only the control of the RX portion of the LMS6002D Transceiver is encompassed in this worker.

\section*{Worker Implementation Details}
\subsection*{\comp.rcc}
A diagram of the receiver in the Lime Microsystems LMS6002D can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:hw}. It consists of a single channel with three separate inputs each with a dedicated LNA. Post LNA, the RF signal is then mixed with a PLL output to directly down convert to baseband. Post mixing, there an programmable gain amplifier, a lowpass filter, and an another programmable gain amplifier. Furthermore, DC offset is applied at the input of the second programmable gain amplifier. The resulting analog receive IQ signals are converted into the digital domain using the on chip ADCs and are provided as an output.\par\medskip
\noindent The features described above are controllable via a SPI interface on the LMS6002D. This proxy is responsible for translating its properties (as described in the Lime datasheet) into the required SPI reads and writes and controlling the worker which performs the SPI transactions.

\section*{Test and Verification}

\textit{\textbf{Note: A component unit test does not exist.  Reference the applications/ for a hardware-in-the-loop test application.}}\\ \medskip

The testbench for this proxy is meant to exercise the properties of the proxy worker dynamically while the application is running. The sample rate is set low and not changed so that there is less data to deal with at the end. The test requires that there be a signal generator capable of generating a sine wave from 300MHz to 3.005GHz connected to the RX interface of the radio. Amplitude levels are suggested below, but if the test yields all zeros for the I/Q values when plotted, consider increasing the signal generator gain. Also, note that the once the test is started, data is being written to file continuously, so completing the test quickly helps with data consistency.\par\medskip
\noindent The following steps are taken in the testbench:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Toggle the input select (only when Matchstiq-Z1 container is detected/being used)
	\item Change the input gain settings
	\item Change pre-lpf gain settings
	\item Change filter values
	\item Tune the center frequency
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Matchstiq-Z1}
For Matchstiq-Z1 testing, the sample rate is set at 100 kS/s. The signal generator amplitude should be set to -55 dBm.
The results should look like the below images:

\subsection*{Zipper Platforms}
For Zipper Platform testing, the sample rate is set at 500 kS/s. The signal generator amplitude should be set to -30 dBm. The results should look like the below images:
