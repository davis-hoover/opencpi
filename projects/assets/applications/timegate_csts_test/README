To verify the timegate_csts_test app, dump the applications workers properties into a file and 
follow the below steps.

 - Step 1: Look at the first metadata record for capture_v2 output. In this array,
    the third entry is the Start of Message Fractional Timestamp and the fourth 
    entry is the Start of Message SecondsTimestamp.

 - Step 2: Look at the test_source time to send. This is the seconds and fractional 
    time to transmit. Take this value and convert it to binary. This will give you 
    the fractional and seconds portions of this number. 
    The fractional is the lower 32 bits and seconds is the upper 32 bits.

 - Step 3: Verify the following three important pieces to determaning success for 
    this test application.
 - - A: The fractional bits from the test_source time to send is marginally close 
         to the recieved Start of Message Fractional Timestamp.
 - - B: The seconds portion of test_source time to send  should be close to the Start 
         of Message Seconds Timestamp, then the test can be considered a success.
 - - C:  The data sent from test_source is what is received by capture_v2; the data 
          samples 0 to 99 are received and the total bytes received is 400 bytes.
