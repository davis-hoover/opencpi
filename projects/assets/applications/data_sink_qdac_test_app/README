# Description
Tests the data_sink_qdac.hdl worker. This test is intended to eventually
supersede any and all ad9361_dac_test applications from all projects, but not
all test coverage has moved over yet.

# Hardware Portability
Currently intended only for platforms with an AD9361 (which has a DAC). Future
testing is expected to support more platform scenarios.

# Execution Prerequisites
The following must be true before application execution:
 * The following assets are built
    - data_sink_qdac_test_asm assembly (from whatever project contains the BSP
      for the intended runtime HDL platform)
    - file_write.rcc (from core project)
    - platform_ad9361_config_proxy.rcc (from platform project)
  * All requirements of core/EXECUTION-PREREQUISITES-README are met
  * The application itself is built.
  * The current directory is the assets project's
    applications/data_sink_qdac_test_app directory.

# Execution Commands
The execution commands herein are subject to change.
This application can not be run with ocpirun, due to reliance on ACI-specific
BER calculation. Future work is planned to move ACI functionality into workers,
which would make ocpirun possible. Note that <path_to_app_xml> can be any OAS
from a data_sink_qdac_test_app application directory from any project. BSP
projects which support this app will have a BSP-specific OAS which may be used
with the assets executable.
./<target>/data_sink_qdac_test_app -t 3 <path_to_app_xml>

# Verification
Upon completion of successful test, the application returns an exit status of 0.
The application will also print the following to the screen upon success:
estimated_BER : 0%
SUCCESS: all data received without bit error
