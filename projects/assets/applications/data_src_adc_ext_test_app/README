# Description
Tests the data_src_adc.hdl worker (and its primitive). Unit test for this worker
fails to build tdue to a bug, so this application is the workaround.

# Hardware Portability
Intended for simulators only.

# Execution Prerequisites
The following must be true before application execution:
 * A simulator is installed on the system.
 * The following assets are built and their build artifacts (FPGA bitstream
   file/shared object file) are contained within the directory list of the
   OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
    - data_src_adc_ext_test_asm assembly
    - file_read.rcc (from core project)
    - file_write.rcc (from core project)
  * The application itself is built.
  * The current directory is the applications/data_src_adc_ext_test_app
    directory.
    directory.

# Execution Commands
./<target>/data_src_adc_ext_test_app

# Verification
Upon completion of successful test, the application returns an exit status of 0.
