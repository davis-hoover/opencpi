The tb_bias_v2 application utilizes the pattern_v2, bias, and capture_v2 components.

The app uses the tb_bias_v2, tb_bias_vhdl_v2, or tb_bias_param_v2 assemblies.

To run the application on an embedded platform, with the assumption you are operating in NFS/Network mode on the
embedded platform and you have your projects mounted at /mnt/ocpi_core and /mnt/ocpi_assets do:

export OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/ocpi_assets/artifacts:/mnt/ocpi_core/artifacts
ocpirun -d -v -x tb_bias_v2

The pattern_v2 component sends the following messages:

msg1 = {0x00000000} with opcode 251, msg2 = {0x00000000,0x00000001} with opcode 252, msg3 = {0x00000000,0x00000001,0x00000002} with opcode 253,
msg4 = {0x00000000,0x00000001,0x00000002,0x00000003} with opcode 254, msg5 = {0x00000000,0x00000001,0x00000002,0x00000003,0x00000004} with opcode 255

The bias component adds the bias value 2 to the data in the messages.

The expected messages capture_v2 will receive are:

msg1 = {0x00000002} with opcode 251, msg2 = {0x00000002,0x00000003} with opcode 252, msg3 = {0x00000002,0x00000003,0x00000004} with opcode 253,
msg4 = {0x00000002,0x00000003,0x00000004,0x00000005} with opcode 254, msg5 = {0x00000002,0x00000003,0x00000004,0x00000005,0x00000006} with opcode 255
