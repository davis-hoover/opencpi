The golden files used in the verification were created from the output of the unit test when running the unit test in simulation. 
Since there might or might not be a perfect match of the output data to the golden data when running the tests in hardware due to 
metastability or phase offset, the output data is correlated with the golden data and if the correlation is at least 70% then the 
test is allowed to pass. This correlation is not to say that the cdc primitives work 70% of the time but it used to account for the 
output, when running in hardware, not being a perfect match to the golden data from simulation.

Currently there is a bug (issue #139) with unit test case generation when using the OnlyPlatorms and ExcludePlatforms xml tags together, 
so once the bug is fixed, there will be hooks to just compare the output data to the golden if running the test in simulation 
and if running in hardware take the correlation.
