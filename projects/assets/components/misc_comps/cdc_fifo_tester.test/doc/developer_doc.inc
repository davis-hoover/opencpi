\section*{Functionality}
The \comp \ serves as a testbench for the \verb+fifo+ cdc primitive. The \verb+fifo+ primitive synchronizes a mulitple bits from the source clock domain to the destination clock domain and is a FIFO where the enqueue and dequeue sides are in different clock domains. There are no restrictions with respect to clock frequencies. The output of the synchronizer is sent to worker's output port.
\section*{Worker Implementation Details}
The \comp \ worker uses a LFSR to generate data and the bits shifted out from LFSR are then used as the input to the \verb+fifo+ primitive. The data from the LFSR is enqueued as long as \verb+fifo+ is not full. The data is dequeued from the \verb+fifo+ primitive when the output port is ready for the data and the \verb+fifo+ is not empty. \\ \\
The \texttt{src\_clk\_hz} and \texttt{dst\_clk\_hz} parameter properties are used to define the source and destination domain clock frequencies. \\ \\
A clock generator is used to generate the clocks for the source and destination clock domains when the source and destination clock domains are different. \\ \\

\section*{Data Timing and Signals}
The \comp \ worker uses the clock from the Control Plane as input to the clock generator. The output of the clock generator is used to drive the output port clock.

\section*{Test and Verification}
There are files used to validate the data the \comp \ worker sends. The files used in the verification were created from the output of the unit test when running the unit test in simulation and contain the expected output data when there is no metastability. Since there might or might not be a perfect match of the output data to the expected output data when running the tests in hardware due to 
metastability or phase offset, the output data is correlated with the expected output data. If there is at least a 0.7 positive Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, then test case is considered passing. This correlation is only used when running the unit test on hardware. If the test are run in simulation, the output data is compared with expected output data. If the they match exactly, then test case is considered passing.
