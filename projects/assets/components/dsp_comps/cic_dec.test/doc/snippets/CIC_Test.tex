\section*{Test and Verification}
Two test cases are implemented to validate the CIC Decimator component:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Impulse response - Input file consists of max Q0.15 values for I and Q followed by zeros
	\item Step response - Input file consists of max Q0.15 values
\end{enumerate}\medskip

For both test cases, verification of the output file is performed using the input file and a python model of the CIC Decimator. The python model can be found in the \textit{opencpi.dsp\_utils} module included with the framework. This unit test also implements \textit{view}, which calls a script for plotting the input and output data files.
