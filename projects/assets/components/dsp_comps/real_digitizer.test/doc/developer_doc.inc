  % If you look through the git history, this file appears to have undergone a
  % 'git mv' such that it was associated with an entirely different component,
  % and then another 'git mv' to revert back. These moves occurred before 1.1 and
  % after 1.3 releases, so it appears that this datasheet for real digitizer
  % didn't even exist for releases 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.
  \hline
  v1.4 & Updated formatting, block diagram, and performance and resource utilization. Updated source dependencies to reflect new assets project directory name. & 9/2018 \\
  \hline
  v1.5 & Added \verb+enable_printing+ and \verb+sync_criteria_met+ properties to \comp{}.rcc. Also added functional diagram and xilinx13\_4 as a tested platform. & 4/2019 \\

\section*{Worker Implementation Details}
\subsection*{\comp.rcc}
This worker performs symbol decisions by decoding signed real Q0.15 symbols into bits. Each positive symbol is decoded to a 1 and each negative symbol is decoded into a 0.
Once the sync criteria is met, the decoded bits are packed into 16-bit words which are subsequently sent to the output port.
The sync criteria is met when a) the \verb+need_sync+ property has a value of false, or b) the first 0xFACE sequence occurs in the decoded bits. When the first 0xFACE sequence occurs in the decoded bits and the \verb+enable_printing+ is true, the following is printed to stdout:
\lstset{language=bash, backgroundcolor=\color{lightgray}, columns=flexible,
        breaklines=true, prebreak=\textbackslash, basicstyle=\ttfamily,
        showstringspaces=false,upquote=true, aboveskip=\baselineskip,
        belowskip=\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}
sync pattern 0xFACE found
