MFSK Mapper: Verify output data

Verify args:
1. Output file used for validation
2. Input file used for comparison

To test the MFSK Mapper, a binary data file is generated containing ramps of 0 to M_p
with a configurable length.

To validate the test, the size and the values of the output file are verified.
