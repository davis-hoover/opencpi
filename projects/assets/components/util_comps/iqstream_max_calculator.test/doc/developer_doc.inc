\section*{Functionality}
\subsection*{in/out ports}
Messages are passed directly from the \verb+in+ port to the \verb+out+ port. Backpressure is transfered to the \verb+in+ port from the \verb+out+ port.
\subsection*{max\_I\_is\_valid Property}
Indicates \verb+max_I+ is valid. Will be false if no data has
                       been received on \verb+in\verb+ port since either a) the last read of
                       \verb+max_I+ or b) the worker first went into the operating
                       state.
\subsection*{max\_Q\_is\_valid Property}
Indicates \verb+max_Q+ is valid. Will be false if no data has
                       been received on \verb+in+ port since either a) the last read of
                       \verb+max_I+ or b) the worker first went into the operating
                       state.
\subsection*{max\_I Property}
Max I value observed on \verb+in+ port. Value will be -32768
                       when worker first enters the operating state and will be
                       reset to -32768 after each read. \verb+max_I_is_valid+ should
                       always be read prior to reading this property because
                       \verb+max_I_is_valid+ will immediately be set to false once
                       \verb+max_I+ is read.
\subsection*{max\_Q Property}
Max Q value observed on \verb+in+ port. Value will be -32768
                       when worker first enters the operating state and will be
                       reset to -32768 after each read. \verb+max_Q_is_valid+ should
                       always be read prior to reading this property because
                       \verb+max_I_is_valid+ will immediately be set to false once
                       \verb+max_Q+ is read.

\section*{Worker Implementation Details}
\subsection*{\comp.hdl}
The \comp.hdl worker has \verb+IDATA_WIDTH_p+ and \verb+ODATA_WIDTH_p+ parameter properties which facilitate the build parameterization of DataWidth of the \verb+in+ and \verb+out+ ports.
