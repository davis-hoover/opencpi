\section*{Functionality}
The timestamper\_scdcd component contains the properties and ports for facilitating timestamping of complex samples with separate control and data clock domains (hence the name ``scdcd"). Note that the actual separation of the clock domain is enforced by the HDL OWD, and not the OCS.

\section*{Worker Implementation Details}
The timestamper\_scdcd.hdl worker has separate clock domains for the \verb+in+ port, \verb+out+ port, and control plane. The \verb+in+ and \verb+out+ ports are supplied with separate clocks from their connected workers.
Timestaping is done by sending ComplexShortWithMetadata-prot time opcode messages whose fract\_sec and sec arguments contain the values provided by the seconds and fraction elements, respectively, of the \verb+time+ TimeInterface. The \verb+time+ TimeInterface is supplied with the \verb+in+ port's clock. Input messages with the time opcode are not passed through. Messages input port with samples and sync opcodes, along with the formed time messages, cross from the \verb+in+ clock domain to the \verb+out+ clock domain via an asynchronous FIFO, and are sent to the \verb+out+ port.
