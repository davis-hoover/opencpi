\section*{Worker Implementation Details}
When writing a value to the txen property that is different from its
       current value, there will be some finite delay before that write action's
       correspond ZLM is sent to the output port. Because the value read from
       the txen property is indicative of the \textit{current} state (i.e. the \textit{last}
       ZLM sent), the readback value of txen may differ from the value
       previously written until some amount of time has passed. If multiple
       property writes somehow occur before their corresponding ZLMs can be
       sent, they are queued for processing. The following table
       gives an example.

  \begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		\rowcolor{blue}
		Action & Time \\
		\hline
      write txen=false                & 0    sec \\
      txOff ZLM sent                  & 0.1  sec \\
      readback value of txen is false & 1    sec \\
      write txen=true                 & 2    sec \\
      readback value of txen is false & 2.1  sec \\
      txOn ZLM sent                   & 2.1  sec \\
      readback value of txen is true  & 2.2  sec \\
      readback value of txen is true  & 2.4  sec \\
      readback value of txen is true  & 2.6  sec \\
      readback value of txen is true  & 2.8  sec \\
