\section*{Functionality}
\begin{flushleft}
  The Socket Write component forwards all incoming data to a TCP port \textit{or} acts as a demultiplexer/router by parsing any protocol and routing different opcodes to various output ports.\par\medskip
  The serving/listening TCP ports, along with various ways to determine the Worker's ``done'' status, are extremely configurable using Properties.\par\medskip

\subsubsection*{\comp.rcc Compilation}
Because OpenCPI maintains backwards compatibility with older compilers, a fully-compliant C++11 environment is \textit{not} required. However, the workaround for non-C++11-compliance is that the ASIO library has dependencies on the Boost\footnote{\url{http://www.boost.org/}} library, \textit{e.g.} on CentOS~6, it requires the \verb+boost-devel+, \verb|boost-thread|, and \verb|boost-static| RPMs.\medskip

To build this component targeting a non-x86 platform, the vendor must provide the appropriate \verb+boost_system+ and \verb+boost_thread+ \textit{static} library files. The Worker's build system will attempt to find them using the \verb+locate+ command in a subdirectory that has \verb+${OCPI_CROSS_HOST}+ within the path.\medskip

See the enclosed \verb+README+ file for more information, including how to add new platforms.

Each listening port requires system resources, such as an open file descriptor. When opening more than a handful of ports, the user may need to use \verb+ulimit+ to increase the number of open file descriptors. To do this temporarily, the command \verb+ulimit -n 2048+ can \textit{sometimes} fix the currently running shell. Consult the documentation for your Operating System to permanently increase the limit for all processes.
\medskip

TCP connections have a large overhead when compared to other transport processes, such as the OpenCPI internal messaging system. Currently, this component \textbf{does not} combine Messages to optimize the outbound connection, \textit{e.g.} taking into account TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS). It is \textit{highly} recommended that users of this Component use a minimum message size of 4K or combine multiple messages in some way in an upstream Component.
\medskip

Data buffers are not returned to the framework nor sent out the optional ``out'' port until \textit{all} TCP clients have acknowledged receipt of their data.
This may result in throttling or a possible denial-of-service attack if a malicious client connects but never accepts data.

\section*{Test and Verification}

\subsubsection*{Usage (local/x86)}
After building the component, the user needs to type \verb+make tests RCC_CONTAINERS=1+ in the \textit{socket\_write.test} directory. Various properties and data flows will be tested to try to cover as many use cases as possible. \\

If the user would like to execute only one test, \verb+TESTS=test_XX+ can be added to the end of the command.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Experimental}: Usage (remote/ARM)}
Full test environment configuration (\textit{e.g.} NFS mounting, \verb+OCPI_CDK_DIR+, etc.) on the remote GPP is beyond the scope of this document. The test procedures assume that both shells' current working directory is the \textit{socket\_write.test} directory (NFS-mounted on remote) and \verb+ocpirun+ is in the remote's current \verb+PATH+. NFS \textbf{must} be used for the scripts to properly verify the outputs. \\

In the host shell, the user types \verb+make tests IP=xx.xx.xx.xx+. A command that can be copied and then pasted into the remote shell will be displayed. \textbf{This command should be executed in less than a minute to ensure the test system begins listening before the host times out.} The timeout can be changed using the \verb+LISTEN_TIMEOUT+ variable. Once the remote shell returns to the bash prompt, pressing ``Enter'' on the host will begin the verification process. \\

Single tests can be performed in the same manner as documented above.

\paragraph{Specific Platform Note - Matchstiq-Z1}
~\\
\\
Some tests have had ``Segmentation Faults'' or ``Alignment Errors'' in certain scenarios on the Z1. The problem becomes most evident when there are multiple clients connected, but has been more rarely observed with even a single client. This seems to happen when both USB ports are used to simultaneously transmit a large amount of data, \textit{e.g.} high log-level output to a USB serial console as well as NFS-mounted output files over a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. The default test setup avoids triggering this by limiting output that is fed to the user, but users should be aware of this issue if non-default test scenarios are attempted. If \texttt{ssh} is used to have all data routed through the USB-to-Ethernet adapter, this failure mode is avoided.\par

\pagebreak

\subsubsection*{Detailed Theory of Operation}
\begin{flushleft}
  Each \verb+test_XX+ subdirectory has the following files:

  \begin{itemize}{}{}
    \item \texttt{description} - a one-line description of the test
    \item \texttt{application.xml} - the OAS XML for the test setup
    \item \texttt{portmap} - (optional) list of TCP ports paired to output files
    \item \texttt{localinclude.mk} - (optional) custom \verb+Makefile+ rules needed for test
    \item \texttt{golden.md5} - (optional) MD5 checksums of golden/expected output
    \item \texttt{generate.[sh|pl|py]} - (optional) script to generate test data
    \item \texttt{verify.sh} - (optional) script to verify output(s)
  \end{itemize}

  Data is sourced with a source component (often \verb+pattern+ or \verb+file_read+) within the OAS. If the former, the source data is encapsulated in the OAS. When the latter, a \verb+generate.py+ script generates the required data. Most OASs dump the ``\texttt{current}'' property to a file \verb+UUT.current.dump+, which is also confirmed to match expected output. Some tests connect a \verb+file_write_demux+ to the \verb+out+ port to verify pass-through operation.
  \medskip

  If \texttt{generate.sh} does not exist, a default one is created that will run \texttt{generate.pl} and/or \texttt{generate.py} if they exist and are executable. This default script is removed with \verb+make clean+.
  \medskip

  At test launch, if a file \texttt{portmap} exists, it launches a Python-based utility script \verb+busy_loop_socket.py+, which opens a client on a given port and repeatedly attempts to connect. Each line is a port number followed by a (relative) file path where the data is written upon successful connection.
  \medskip

  If \texttt{verify.sh} does not exist, a default one is created that will ensure the application did not time out and then run \texttt{md5sum} to verify all the checksums listed in \texttt{golden.md5}. This default script is also removed upon \verb+make clean+.
\end{flushleft}
\end{document}
