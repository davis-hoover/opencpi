This directory contains various OpenCPI projects. These descriptions of some are from a high-level view.

core - This contains the minimum project needed to experience OpenCPI, e.g. bias.test. It contains:
  * Components and Workers such as file_read and file_write as well as Framework internals
  * RCC (GPP) Platforms such as centos7 and xilinx13_3 (used by most Zynq-7000-based systems)
  * HDL Simulation Platforms such as modelsim and xsim

platform - This contains reference platforms and support for generic devices and
cards. Criteria for content to exist in this OpenCPI project:
  * specs/
     - component specs must facilitate generic device worker or platform support
  * hdl/primitives/
     - must directly support assets within hdl/devices, hdl/cards, or
       hdl/platforms, or be useful and used by devices in OSPs
  * hdl/devices/
     - generic device workers belong here
     - RF ADC/DAC command/control: device proxies must implement the latest
       generation dig_radio_ctrlr component
     - ADC/DAC data flow: de-interleaving/interleaving subdevice workers must
       support the latest generation ADC/DAC data flow paradigm workers
       data_src_qadc.hdl/data_sink_qdac.hdl
  * hdl/cards/
      - reusable card specs belong here
      - card-specific device workers for reusable cards belong here
  * hdl/platforms/
     - current reference platforms (relatively cheap and supported with high
       priority with as many software and hardware options as possible - e.g. zed,
       ultrascale/ZCU104, etc.)
     - note that non-reference platforms ("full-fledged OSPs") belong in their
       own, separate, OpenCPI project

assets - This is the main library project provided by the OpenCPI maintainers, containing:
  * Example Applications, e.g. FSK modulation
  * Components and Workers partitioned into various libraries by type, e.g. dsp_comps
  * HDL Platforms such as Epiq's Matchstiq Z1 and Altera's Stratix 4 Development Board (ALST4)

inactive - This project is the "catch-all" for anything not in the above projects. This would include Platforms
that are not officially supported (e.g. fedora25 or ML555), Components that have not been fully vetted or are
being retired, etc. Inclusion within this project is neither an indication that something should be avoided nor
that it is being promoted; it is simply not actively being maintained currently by the core OpenCPI team.
