\section*{Functionality}
\begin{flushleft}
The File\_Read component injects file-based data into an application. It is used
by specifying an instance of the File\_Read component, and connecting its output port to
an input port of the component which will process the data first. The name of the file to
be read is specified in a property.
\subsection*{Operating Modes}
\subsubsection*{Data Streaming Mode}
In data streaming mode, the contents of the file becomes the payloads of a stream of
messages, each carrying a fixed number of bytes of file data and all with
the same opcode. The length and opcode of all output messages are specified as
properties. This means that this mode only lends itself to protocols that have a single opcode or the intent is to only send data on one of the opcodes of a multi-opcode protocol.\\ \medskip \medskip
If the number of bytes in the file is not an even multiple of the message size the
remaining bytes are sent in a final shorter message. The granularity of messages can
also be specified. This forces the message size to be a multiple of this value, and
forces truncation of the final message to be a multiple of this value.
\newpage
\subsubsection*{Messaging Mode}
In messaging mode, the contents of the file are interpreted as a sequence of defined
messages, with an 8-byte header in the file itself preceding the payload for each message.
This header contains the length and opcode of the message, with the data contents of
the message following the header. The length can be zero, meaning that a message
will be sent with the indicated opcode, and the length of the message will be zero.\\
\medskip \medskip
\input{snippets/messaging_snippet}
\subsection*{No Protocol}
The port on the component has no protocol specified.  This means that the data file must be formatted to match the protocol of the input port of the connected worker.  For message mode this means only using opcodes and payloads in the file that correspond to the protocol of the connected component.  In data streaming mode the file structure needs to correspond to the opcode that is set by the \textit{opcode} property.
\subsection*{Message Size/Buffers}
The system normally determines buffer sizes based on protocol.  Since File\_Read's output port has no protocol, the protocol used is that of the port that this output port is connected to.  If the connected port also has no protocol, then the system's default of 2KB is chosen.  This chosen buffer size can always be overriden in the OAS or with ACI PValues for \textit{any} connection in the application.\\ \medskip

The \textbf{messageSize} property for this component has a default value of zero, which means the system's (or application's) chosen buffer size is used.  If set to non-zero, it overrides the system/application value, which risks trying to write messages larger than the system is prepared for, resulting in an error.\\ \medskip

If the \textbf{messagesInFile} property is true (i.e. the component is operating in messaging mode), the buffer size must be large enough to accommodate the largest message found in the input file.  It is always better to set the buffer size on connections in the OAS (or using PValues in the ACI) than to use the \textbf{messageSize} property since the former method is universal for specifying buffer sizes for all connections in the application.\\ \medskip

For example the iqstream protocol uses a sequence of 2048 16-bit I/Q pairs which means any message over 8192 (2048 * 4 bytes per pair) is invalid.
\subsection*{End of File Handling}
When the File\_Read component reaches the end of its input file, it will do one of three
things:
\begin{itemize}
  \item send a end of file notification
  \item enter the ``done'' state with no further action, when the \textit{suppressEOF} property
is true
  \item restart reading at the beginning of the file, when the \textit{repeat} property is true
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

\section*{Worker Implementation Details}
\subsection*{\comp.hdl}
\begin{flushleft}
This worker will only run on simulator platforms.  This includes isim, xsim, and modelsim and will not run on or be built for any other hardware platforms.  This is because it conatins code that cannot be realized into RTL.
\end{flushleft}
\subsection*{\comp.rcc}
\begin{flushleft}
This worker in implemented in the C language version of the RCC model.  Most new workers are implemented in the C++ language version of the RCC model.
