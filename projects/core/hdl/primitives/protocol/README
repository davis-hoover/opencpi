This library provides VHDL packages which aid in handling of OpenCPI port
protocols and their messages. Examples include ZLM detection, message sizing,
and separation of data streaming and metadata. Each protocol within this
OpenCPI project is expected to have a separate VHDL package.

The complex_short_with_metadata package provides marshalling functionality for
ports using the OpenCPI ComplexShortWithMetadata protocol. The "old"
primitive(s) perform(s) more optimally that the non-"old" version(s) in terms
of I/Q throughput, but "old" have known defects for some metadata opcodes.
TODO / FIXME - the optimal features need to be implemented in any non-"old"
versions (which have no known defects), and then all "old" versions should be
deleted.

The iqstream package provides marshalling functionality for ports using the
OpenCPI iqstream protocol.
