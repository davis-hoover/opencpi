This CDC (clock domain crossing) library uses the following abbreviations:

These prefixes are used
src_ - the source/input clock domain that will be crossed to the destination domain
dst_ - the destination clock domain that (most) outputs are in

clk - clock
rst - reset
en  - enable
in  - data inputs
out - data outputs

Parameters are:
width - width of data path doing the cdc

Usage is normally using:

  library cdc;

And then in your code use, e.g.:

  something: component cdc.cdc.fifo ...

If a module is called XXX it means that the module is an XXX that crosses from SRC to DST clock domains.
