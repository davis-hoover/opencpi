This library provides the VHDL packages and modules for the timed-sample protocol. 
The complex_short package aids in handling OpenCPI port protocols and their 
messages. As they are created, this library will include each datatype for the 
timed_sample protocol. These datatypes do not need to be in the same package.
However, can be if deemed appropriate.

The complex_short_timed_sample package provides marshalling functionality for
ports using the OpenCPI timed_sample protocol. TO-DO/Fix-Me: Optimize by
improving data width robustness. This should look different between having
a 16 bit vs. a 32 bit data width.
