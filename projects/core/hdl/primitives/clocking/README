PRELIMINARY
This library contains vendor specific clocking IP and vendor agnostic clocking based on phased-locked loops.

NOTE: zynq ultrascale and zynq ultrascale+ use different versions of the mmcm and pll primitives. 
OpenCPI lumps zynq utlrascale and ultrascale+ under the zynq_ultra target. OpenCPI will need
to make the distinction between the two or handle it better at some point if a platform that
uses zynqultrascale is ever added.

The clock_generator.vhd wraps the vendor specific IP and the vendor agnostic version of clock_generator.vhd 
implements something similar to the vendor IP.

Not all of the generics of clock_generator.vhd are used by the various implementations. 

Description of the generics for clock_generator.vhd:
CLK_PRIMITIVE - Used when a vendor has multiple clock primitives or versions for a part. For Xilinx
the appropriate values for this generic for the Zynq 7000 series are mmcme2 and plle2. For 
Zynq Ultrscale+ the appropriate values are mmcme4 and plle4. For Altera Cyclone V the appropriate 
value is altera_pll.
VENDOR - Used to distinguish between FPGA vendors. Valid names are altera, xilinx,
and agnostic (for the vendor agnostic clock generator).
CLK_IN_FREQUENCY_MHz  - Input clock frequency in MHz.
CLK_OUT_FREQUENCY_MHz - Output clock frequency in MHz.
REFERENCE_CLOCK_FREQUENCY - Input clock frequency (as a string input). Used for the Altera PLL.
OUTPUT_CLOCK_FREQUENCY0   - Output clock frequency (as a string input). Used for the Altera PLL.
M - The multiply factor for a phase-locked loop.
N - The divide factor for a phase-locked loop. Xilinx calls it D and Intel calls it N.
O - For phase-locked loops with muitlple outputs, this is the output divide factor. Xilinx calls it O and Intel calls it C.
CLK_OUT_PHASE_DEGREES - Phase shift of the output clock in degrees.
PHASE_SHIFT0_PICO_SECS - Phase shift of the output clock in picoseconds (as as a string input). Used for the Altera PLL.
CLK_OUT_DUTY_CYCLE - Duty cycle of output clock (used by non vendor agnostic clock generators).
