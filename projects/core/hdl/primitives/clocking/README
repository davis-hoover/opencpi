PRELIMINARY
This library contains vendor specific clocking ip and vendor agnostic clocking based on phased-locked loops.

The clock_generator.vhd wraps the vendor specific ip and the vendor agnostic version of clock_generator.vhd 
implements something similar to the vendor IP.

Not all of the generics of clock_generator.vhd are used by the various implementations. 

Description of the generics of clock_generator.vhd:
CLK_PRIMITIVE - Used when a vendor has multiple clock primitives or versions for a part
CLK_IN_FREQUENCY_MHz  - Input clock frequency in MHz
CLK_OUT_FREQUENCY_MHz - Output clock frequency in MHz
M - The multiply factor for a phase-locked loop
N - The divide factor for a phase-locked loop. Xilinx calls it D and Intel calls it N
O - For phase-locked loops with muitlple outputs, this is the output divide factor. Xilinx calls it O and Intel calls it C
CLK_OUT_DUTY_CYCLE - Duty cycle of output clock
