This (test) platform is a "quad-word-wide" platform that runs the SDP subsystem under simulation 128 bits wide.
This exercises lots of SDP-related modules in this wide mode, and also forces various width adapters to be used.
E.g. the control plane adapter must go from 128 bits to 32 bits, and most app workers are 32 bits wide.
It is not just a "platform confguration" of the xsim platform so that it is easy to build and test all
assemblies by just building and testing for x4sim.
