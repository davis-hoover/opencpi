This directory contains information and scripts for installing and building
OpenCPI for CentOS 8 Stream.  This is a work in progress, and is based on the
CentOS 7 scripts.

What must be accomplished falls into one of the three categories below:

1. Install - things you must do *before* building OpenCPI infrastructure, components and apps.
2. Build - how to actually build all of OpenCPI.
3. Setup - things to do after building in order to use the platform to run apps.

The OpenCPI Installation Manual (in doc/OpenCPI_Installation_Guide.pdf) will
eventually contain all the pertinent information.
