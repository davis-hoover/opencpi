This directory contains information and scripts for installing and building
OpenCPI for *ubuntu 18.04. This is a work in progress, and is based on the
ubuntu16_04 scripts.  N.B.: "/bin/sh" points to "/bin/dash" by default, not
"/bin/bash", and the principle of least astonishment is likely going to
be repeatedly violated as the porting work continues.

What must be accomplished falls into one of the three categories below:

1. Install - things you must do *before* building OpenCPI infrastructure, components and apps.
2. Build - how to actually build all of OpenCPI.
3. Setup - things to do after building in order to use the platform to run apps.

The OpenCPI Installation Manual (in doc/OpenCPI_Installation_Guide.pdf) will
eventually contain all the pertinent information.

Miscellaneous notes:

(1) Installing the "lsb" metapackage takes care of installing much of the
    required development functionality, and some of the 32-bit support
    framework.  In particular "lsb" gets you all of the "lsb-*" packages,
    "fakeroot", compilers, and the base 32-bit runtime libraries.

(2) The "curl" package is not part of the base installation.  WTF?

(3) No "make" command by default, so that needs to be pre-installed.
    Actually, this was subsequently determined to be a subtle bug in
    the way "install-opencpi.sh" initially called "ocpitarget.sh".
    If not called with an argument indicating we're in "bootstrap"
    mode, there's a dependency on "make" which is an issue because
    "ubuntu18_04-packages.sh" hasn't happened at that point.
