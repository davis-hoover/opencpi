This directory contains information and scripts for installing and building
OpenCPI for *ubuntu 18.04.  N.B.: "/bin/sh" points to "/bin/dash" by default,
not "/bin/bash".

What must be accomplished falls into one of the three categories below:

1. Install - things you must do *before* building OpenCPI infrastructure, components and apps.
2. Build - how to actually build all of OpenCPI.
3. Setup - things to do after building in order to use the platform to run apps.

The OpenCPI Installation Guide (OpenCPI_Installation_Guide.pdf) will eventually
contain all the pertinent information.  The latest release of the guide should
normally be available on-line at "https://opencpi.gitlab.io".

Miscellaneous notes:

(1) Installing the "lsb" metapackage takes care of installing much of the
    required development functionality, and some of the 32-bit support
    framework.  In particular "lsb" gets you all of the "lsb-*" packages,
    "fakeroot", compilers, and the base 32-bit runtime libraries.

(2) The "curl" package is not part of the base installation.  Principle
    of least astonishment definitely violated.

(3) Early dependencies on "make" and "python3" (at least one of which is
    not installed by default) were fixed by reworking the scripts that
    inappropriately called those programs prior to installing the distro-
    specific packages (which happens in "ubuntu18_04-packages.sh").
