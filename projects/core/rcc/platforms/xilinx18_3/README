This Platform is created using the xilinx linux repo "https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git" 
tag xilinx-v2018.3.  It is named 18_3 because it was released in the 3rd or 4th quarter of 2018.

To create this platform the following changes were made beyond simply copying the xilinx13_4 directory:

1. The Xilinx Vivado tools 2018.3 and the associated SDK were installed.

2. Changes to the xilinx18_3.mk file different from xilinx13_3:

   - Do not specify or check a particular SDK version, just use the installed version.
     This shiould be fixed when the compatibility issues are clearer.

   - Locate the compiler tools in a different place in the SDK (vs 2015.4)

   - Remove the -mfloat-abi=softp option

3. Changes made to the createXilinxKernelHeaders.sh script were:

   - Update the script to be correct for OpenCPI 1.4
   - Accomodate (backwards-compatibly) some changes in the names of kernel config options for USB/Ethernet
   - Accomodate (backwards compatibly) changes in the location of the libstdc++ library in the newer SDK.

4. Changes make to the runtime/hdl-support/xilinx/xilinx.mk script were:

   - Accomodate (backwards compatibly) changes in the name of the settings startup file in the 2018.3 SDK

5. The Xilinx Binary Zynq release(s)

   - Now only available per platform (e.g. zed) rather than one for all platforms
   - The 2018.3 zed release was tricky to download, and now requires a xilinx download account.
