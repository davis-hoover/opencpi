web installers locked by my VMs, so I had to download files specifically.
was confused since Vivado installation actually installed some stuff in the SDK dir, but not all?
so then downloaded the petalinux files (under embedded development tab)
specifically did yum-install on chrpath socat xterm ncurses and openssl as requested.
then also yum install ncurses-devel and openssl-devel

It mentioned that it did not find tftp and that the install guide wouild tell you the impact of that.

The peta install was a terminal thing and then it said I hadn't specified installation location so do it in CWD.
Hopefully the installation will be moveable...

ran installer for pico using "sh" - needed to use bash, and be IN the dir to install
