This directory contains information and scripts for installing and building
OpenCPI for *ubuntu 16.04.  N.B.: "/bin/sh" points to "/bin/dash" by default,
not "/bin/bash".

What must be accomplished falls into one of the three categories below:

1. Install - things you must do *before* building OpenCPI infrastructure, components and apps.
2. Build - how to actually build all of OpenCPI.
3. Setup - things to do after building in order to use the platform to run apps.

The OpenCPI Installation Guide (OpenCPI_Installation_Guide.pdf) will eventually
contain all the pertinent information.  The latest release of the guide should
normally be available on-line at "https://opencpi.gitlab.io".

Miscellaneous notes:

(1) Installing the "lsb" metapackage takes care of installing much of the
    required development functionality, and some of the 32-bit support
    framework.  In particular "lsb" gets you all of the "lsb-*" packages,
    "fakeroot", compilers, and the base 32-bit runtime libraries.

(2) The "curl" package is not part of the base installation.  Principle
    of least astonishment definitely violated.
