    * In a receive stream, this message is a timestamp for the first sample of the sample message that

    * until the next time message appears. In a receive stream, this message is generated by the ADC and 
    * should be passed on by all workers in the receive stream.  In a transmit stream, this message is a 
    * requested time to transmit the samples message that follows it. In a transmit stream, this message 
    * is generated by whichever worker is generating data and should be passed on by all workers in the data 
    * stream.

    * a flush operation should also be sent on that port after all the data has been sent.
