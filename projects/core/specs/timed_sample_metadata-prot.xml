  <!-- Time of the first sample in the next sample message, with subsequent
       sample messages being continuous to this message.

       In a receive path, time is the receive time of samples. In a transmit
       path, time is the time the samples are to be transmitted.

       Time format is GPS time.

       Components which discard or insert samples must update time messages so
       that any forwarded on time messages correctly related to the next sample
       message output by the component.

       Time is stored as an unsigned Q32.40 fixed point value, where the
       ``seconds`` argument is the value before the decimal point and the
       ``fraction`` argument is the value after the decimal point. The
       fractional bits occupy the 40 most significant bits of the ulonglong.-->
  <operation name="time">  
    <argument name="fraction" type="ulonglong"/>
    <argument name="seconds" type="ulong"/>
  </operation>
  <!-- Time between sample points (i.e. the reciprocal of the sample rate).
       In the same format as the time operation to allow direction addition of
       sample interval values to time values.

       Components which discard samples, insert samples or change the sample
       rate in any way, must update sample interval messages so the sample
       interval values sent from a component is a true reflection of the sample
       interval used in sample messages output by the component.

       Sample interval is stored as an unsigned Q32.40 fixed point value,
       where the ``seconds`` argument is the value before the decimal point and
       the ``fraction`` argument is the value after the decimal point. The
       fractional bits occupy the 40 most significant bits of the ulonglong.-->
  <operation name="sample_interval">
    <argument name="fraction" type="ulonglong"/>
    <argument name="seconds" type="ulong"/>
  </operation>
  <!-- Instructs workers to flush all internal buffers of the worker that relate
       to the input port this message is received on, so all input data received
       before this message is processed and output without the need for
       additional input data.

       Internal buffers are often flushed by feeding in zeros.

       Once all data has been flushed (or if there is no internal buffer to
       clear) the flush message must be forwarded on; this includes cases where
       a flush message would be output during the flush itself. -->
  <operation name="flush"/>
  <!-- Indicates that the next sample message is discontinuous from the previous
       sample message. -->
  <operation name="discontinuity"/>
  <!-- Additional information relating to the sample messages.

       The ``id`` argument stores an ID value for the type of metadata message.
       Each ID value is unique to a type of metadata.

       The ``value`` argument is the metadata value asscioated with the ID. This
       has an type of ulonglong, so combined the ID and value arguments have a
       data length which is the same as the time and sample interval messages;
       to allow workers which do not process these fields to use the same logic
       for all message types.

       Workers must make the best possible effort to maintain the alignment of
       metadata messages within sample values of sample messages.-->
