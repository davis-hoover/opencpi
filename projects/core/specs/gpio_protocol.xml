<!-- GPIO Protocol  -->
<!-- The protocol contains a data and mask. The MSW must be the mask and the LSW must be the data.
     General Purpose Output - The mask allows setting GPIO pins on or off in a single operation.
     In order for a GPIO pin to take on the value of a data bit, the corresponding mask bit has to be set to 1.
     For example if mask_data = 0x00010003, the mask = 0x0001 and data = 0x0003. This would set GPIO pin 0 to 1 and
     all other pins are left untouched
     General Purpose Input - The mask allows knowledge of which GPIO pins changed since the previous read cycle.
     The mask is the current data XOR the previous data. -->
