<!-- base specification for all platform workers
     properties and signals here are the ones that all platforms must support
     These categories:
       1. parameters (i.e. that must and always will be parameters)
       2. non-parameters that must exist, in a proscribed order
       3. properties that could (and usually should) be parameters, but may not be
       4. non-parameters that are required
