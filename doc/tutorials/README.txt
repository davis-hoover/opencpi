This directory contains OpenCPI tutorials. A tutorial is an interactive,
“how to” learning document that teaches by example and supplies the 
information necessary to complete a particular task. A tutorial presents
one or more objectives and goals and one or more step-by-step examples
that demonstrate how to achieve these objectives and goals. A tutorial
requires a reader to participate by performing each step that the
tutorial describes.

OpenCPI provides the following tutorials:

Tutorial 1: Introduction to OpenCPI Component-based Application Development.
This tutorial demonstrates the OpenCPI application and component development
workflow and processes using a simple application.

Tutorial 2: Designing Applications and HDL Assemblies. This tutorial
demonstrates how to create an application from components that exist
in other libraries in other projects and how to create different HDL
assemblies for the application.

Tutorial 3: Developing an RCC Worker. This tutorial demonstrates the
design process for an RCC worker implementation.

Tutorial 4: Using Third-party Libraries in RCC Workers. This tutorial
demonstrates how to integrate a third-party library into an RCC worker.

Tutorial 5: Using Multiple Opcodes in RCC Workers.  This tutorial
demonstrates how to use multiple opcodes in an RCC worker by creating,
building, and running a "time demux" RCC worker.

Tutorial 6: Creating a Simple HDL Worker.  This tutorial demonstrates
the design process for a simple HDL worker implementation.

Tutorial 6hw: Creating a Simple HDL Worker (hardware version).
This tutorial is the same as Tutorial 6, but it demonstrates
how to build and run the HDL worker on both simulator and
hardware platforms.

Tutorial 7: Using HDL Primitives.  This tutorial demonstrates the
how to create and use an HDL primitive library in an HDL worker.

Tutorial 7hw: Using HDL Primitives (hardware version).  This tutorial
is the same as Tutorial 7, but it demonstrates how to build and run
the HDL worker on both simulator and hardware platforms.

Tutorial 8: Using Third-Party HDL Primitive Cores.  This tutorial
demonstrates how to create an HDL worker that uses HDL primitive
cores imported from a third party.

Tutorial 8hw: Using Third-Party HDL Primitive Cores (hardware version).
This tutorial is the same as Tutorial 8, but it demonstrates how
to build and run the HDL worker on both simulator and hardware platforms.

Tutorial 9: Debugging an HDL Worker on a Hardware Platform.  This tutorial
demonstrates how to use OpenCPI tools to debug an HDL worker on a
hardware platform.

Tutorial 10: Introduction to OpenCPI Application Development.  This
tutorial demonstrates the design process for an OpenCPI application.

These tutorials are meant to be run in sequence.
