This directory contains OpenCPI tutorials. A tutorial is an interactive, “how to” learning document that teaches by example and supplies the information necessary to complete a particular task. A tutorial presents one or more objectives and goals and one or more step-by-step examples that demonstrate how to achieve these objectives and goals. A tutorial requires a reader to participate by performing each step that the tutorial describes.

OpenCPI provides the following tutorials:

Tutorial 0: Setting up an OpenCPI Workspace. This tutorial is a pre-cursor to a set of tutorials numbered 1 through 9. It illustrates how to set up a blank Eclipse workspace and import pre-built projects for use in subsequent tutorials.

Tutorial 1: Understanding the OpenCPI Application Development Workflow. This tutorial demonstrates the OpenCPI application development workflow and processes using the OpenCPI FSK reference application.

Tutorial 2: Creating Worker Assemblies. This tutorial demonstrates how to create, build, test and run RCC and HDL worker assemblies.

Tutorial 3: Creating a Peak Detector Workflow. This tutorial illustrates how to create, build, test and run a peak detector RCC worker.

Tutorial 4: Creating a Complex Mixer Component. This tutorial describes how to create, build, test and run a complex mixer component and RCC worker.

Tutorial 5: Creating a Time Demux Component. This tutorial illustrates how to create, build, test and run a time demux component and RCC worker.

Tutorial 6: Creating a Simple HDL Worker. This tutorial demonstrates how to create, build, test and run a peak detector HDL worker.

Tutorial 7: Creating an HDL Worker that Uses an HDL Primitive Library. This tutorial describes how to create, build, test and run an “automatic gain control” HDL worker.

Tutorial 8: Creating an HDL Worker that Uses Third-Party Cores. This tutorial illustrates how to create, build and test a complex mixer HDL worker.

Tutorial 9: Debugging and HDL Worker on a Hardware Platform. This tutorial demonstrates how to debug OpenCPI applications with OpenCPI debugging utilities.

These tutorials are meant to be run in sequence starting with Tutorial 1.

This directory also provides the following stand-alone tutorials:

- Using the OpenCPI Application Control Interface (ACI). This tutorial demonstrates how to create and compile an ACI application, how to use the control pane and how to access the data plane.

- Using OpenCPI Debugging Tools. This tutorial describes how to use OpenCPI debugging tools to collect HDL device and worker information, view worker lifecycles, change and view worker properties and debug workers.
