This directory contains OpenCPI tutorials. A tutorial is an interactive,
“how to” learning document that teaches by example and supplies the 
information necessary to complete a particular task. A tutorial presents
one or more objectives and goals and one or more step-by-step examples
that demonstrate how to achieve these objectives and goals. A tutorial
requires a reader to participate by performing each step that the
tutorial describes.

OpenCPI provides the following tutorials:

Tutorial 1: Introduction to OpenCPI Application Development.
This tutorial demonstrates the OpenCPI application development
workflow and processes using the OpenCPI FSK reference application.

Tutorial 1a: Using the OpenCPI Application Control Interface (ACI).
This tutorial demonstrates how to create and compile an ACI application,
how to use the control plane and how to access the data plane.

Tutorial 1b: Introduction to Component-based Development. This tutorial
demonstrates the process of component-based development with OpenCPI.
It shows how to create the OpenCPI assets required by an example
OpenCPI application and how to build and run the application on
HDL (FPGA) and RCC (software) platforms.

Tutorial 2: Creating Worker Assemblies. This tutorial demonstrates
how to create, build, test and run RCC and HDL worker assemblies.

Tutorial 3: Creating a Peak Detector Worker. This tutorial illustrates
how to create, build, test and run a peak detector RCC worker.

Tutorial 4: Creating a Complex Mixer Component. This tutorial 
describes how to create, build, test and run a complex mixer component
and RCC worker.

Tutorial 5: Creating a Time Demux Component. This tutorial illustrates
how to create, build, test and run a time demux component and RCC worker.

Tutorial 6: Creating a Simple HDL Worker. This tutorial demonstrates how
to create, build, test and run a peak detector HDL (FPGA) worker on a
software-only SDR platform.

Tutorial 6hw: Creating a Simple HDL Worker. This tutorial demonstrates how
to create, build, test and run a peak detector HDL (FPGA) worker on
supported SDR hardware platforms.

Tutorial 7: Creating an HDL Worker that Uses an HDL Primitive Library.
This tutorial describes how to create, build, test and run an
“automatic gain control” HDL worker on a software-only SDR platform.

Tutorial 7hw: Creating an HDL Worker that Uses an HDL Primitive Library.
This tutorial describes how to create, build, test and run an
“automatic gain control” HDL worker on the supported SDR
hardware platforms.

Tutorial 8: Creating an HDL Worker that Uses Third-Party Cores.
This tutorial illustrates how to create, build and test a complex
mixer HDL worker on a software-only SDR platform.

Tutorial 8hw: Creating an HDL Worker that Uses Third-Party Cores.
This tutorial illustrates how to create, build and test a complex
mixer HDL worker on the supported SDR hardware platforms.

Tutorial 9a: Using OpenCPI Debugging Tools. This tutorial describes
how to use OpenCPI debugging tools to collect HDL device and worker
information, view worker lifecycles, change and view worker properties
and debug workers.

Tutorial 9: Debugging an HDL Worker on a Hardware Platform.
This tutorial demonstrates how to debug OpenCPI applications
on hardware platforms with OpenCPI debugging utilities.

Tutorial 9a: Using OpenCPI Debugging Tools. This tutorial provides
information on OpenCPI debugging tools and how to use them.

These tutorials are meant to be run in sequence.

This directory also provides the tutorial directory, which
contains source material for examples used in the tutorials.
