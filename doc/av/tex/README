In order to manually build the latex documentation in this folder, various dependencies are required to be installed.

Run:
$ sudo yum install -y texlive-latex rubber ghostscript
For CentOS 7, the packages needed are:
$ sudo yum install -y texlive-latex-bin texlive-texconfig-bin texlive-metafont-bin texlive-cm texlive-pdftex-def texlive-ifluatex texlive-zapfding texlive-helvetic texlive-times texlive-symbol texlive-titlesec texlive-multirow texlive-dvips texlive-fancyhdr texlive-collection-fontsrecommended texlive-microtype texlive-rotating texlive-placeins texlive-appendix texlive-xstring

To build a single PDF from sources, run:
$ rubber --pdf <filename>.tex

To build multiples, see the "generator" subdirectory. To build all documentation, "make doc" from the top-level.
These two commands handle ALL documentation in the repository, including some OpenOffice documents.
To convert those, you must also install "unoconv" package.

To spell check your edits, run:
aspell list < filename.tex | sort | uniq -c | less
(You might want to save this off and do a before/after comparison to only see what you added.)

Notes:
Please only add to the "sudo yum" files and do not modify the prefix; those lines are parsed by a script elsewhere.
If you change them in any way, please contact the Jenkins administrator so the Docker container can be updated.
