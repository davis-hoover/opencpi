\section{Definitions}
\begin{description}[style=nextline]
\item[Accessibility]
See \textit{configuration property accessibility}.

\item[Adapter Worker]
\textit{Worker} used when two connected workers are not connectable in some way due to different interface choices in the \textit{OWD}.
Adapter workers are normally inserted automatically as needed, \textit{e.g.} between a \textit{worker} that has a 16-bit bus and one with a 32-bit one.

\item[Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI)]
Industry-standard bus used by ARM processors.

\item[Application]
\subitem[noun] In this context of Component-Based Development, an \textit{application} is a composition or assembly of \textit{components} that, as a whole, perform some useful function.
\subitem[adjective] The term ``application'' can also be used to distinguish functions or code from infrastructure to support the execution of a component-based application, \textit{e.g.} a \textit{device worker} vs. an \textit{application worker}.

\item[Application Specification (OAS)]
An XML document that describes the collection of \textit{components} along with their interconnections and configuration properties in an OpenCPI \textit{application}.

\item[Application Worker]
Implementation of a function used in an \textit{application}, generally portable and hardware independent.

\item[Argument]
See \textit{operation argument}.

\item[Artifact]
A file containing executable code for one or more \textit{workers}  for a specific \textit{platform}.

\item[Authoring Model]
One of several ways of creating \textit{component} implementations in a specific language using a specific API between the component and its execution environment.  Existing models include RCC and HDL. %, and OCL.

\item[Board Support Package]
A \textit{project} that defines all items needed to enable OpenCPI on a given hardware and/or software \textit{platform}. This includes, but is not limited to, \textit{platform workers}, \textit{device workers}, configuration of software cross-compilers, etc.

\item[Component]
Interface ``contract'' that is specified by a \textit{component specification} and implemented by an \textit{application worker}.

\item[Component Development Kit]
Set of tools, scripts, documents, and libraries used for developing \textit{components} and \textit{workers} in \textit{projects}.

\item[Component Library]

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\item[Component Specification (OCS)]
An XML document that describes both \textit{configuration properties} and zero or more data interfaces (\textit{protocol specifications}) of a \textit{component}, establishing interface requirements for multiple implementations (\textit{workers}) in \textbf{any} authoring model.

\caption{Relationship between \textit{OCS} and \textit{OWD}s}

\end{center}
\end{figure}
\end{minipage}

\item[Configuration Properties]
\subitem See also \textit{configuration property accessibility}.

Named values of a \textit{worker} that may be read or written by \textit{control software}.
Their values indicate or control aspects of the \textit{worker}'s operation.
Reading and writing these property values may or may not have side effects on the operation of the \textit{worker}.
Configuration properties with side effects can be used for custom worker control.
Each \textit{worker} may have its own, possibly unique, set of configuration properties.
They may include hardware resources such registers, memory, and state.

\item[Configuration Property Accessibility]
Declarations within an \textit{OCS} or \textit{OWD} that indicate \textbf{when} it is valid to read from or write to a \textit{configuration property}.
The various accessibility attributes (defined in the \textit{Component Development Guide}) establish the rules in relation to the \textit{worker}'s \textit{lifecycle} or declare the property as fixed at build-time (see \textit{Parameter}).

\item[Containers]
OpenCPI infrastructure element that ``contains,'' manages, and executes a set of application \textit{workers}. Logically, the container ``surrounds'' the workers, mediating all interactions between the \textit{workers} and the rest of the system.

\item[Control Operations]
A fixed set of control operations that every \textit{worker} has. The control aspect is a common control model that allows all workers to be managed without having to customize the management infrastructure software for each worker, while \textit{configuration properties} are used to specialize components.

\item[Control Plane]
Control and configuration interfaces for runtime \textit{lifecycle} control and configuration of \textit{worker} instances at runtime.

\item[Control Software (AKA Control Application AKA Control Agent)]
The entity that is exercising control using the \textit{ACI}. Encompasses the various aspects of how \textit{control software}, usually running in a centralized host processing environment, can control \textit{worker} instances at runtime via the \textit{control plane}.

\item[Core]
The \textit{project} containing the default \textit{workers} and infrastructure VHDL for the framework to operate.

\item[Data Plane]
Data passing interfaces used for \textit{workers} to consume/produce data from/to other workers in the \textit{application} (of whatever \textit{authoring model} in whatever \textit{container}).

\item[Device Proxy]
A device proxy is a software \textit{worker} (RCC/C++) that is specifically paired with a \textit{device worker} in order to translate a higher level control interface for a class of devices into the lower level actions required on a specific device.

\item[Device Worker]
Special \textit{worker} used for controlling hardware physically attached to an FPGA, \textit{e.g.} a status LED.

\item[Hardware Description Language]
Refers to a specialized language used to program the structure design and operation of digital logic circuits. In OpenCPI, it is an \textit{authoring model} using the VHDL language and is targeted at FPGAs. HDL \textit{workers} should be developed according to the \textit{HDL authoring model} and which is described in the ``OpenCPI HDL Development Guide.''

\item[HDL Assembly]
A fixed composition of HDL \textit{workers} that can act as subset of a heterogeneous OpenCPI \textit{application}.

\item[HDL Assembly Description (OHAD)]
The XML file that describes an \textit{HDL assembly}.
