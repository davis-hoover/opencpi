.SH "NAME"
ocpidev-slot \- manage an OpenCPI HDL slot\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBocpidev\fR [\fI<options>\fR] \fI<verb>\fR \fBhdl slot\fR \fI<name>\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBhdl slot\fR noun represents an OpenCPI HDL slot, which defines an integral part of an HDL platform that enables an \fIHDL card\fR to be plugged in to make its attached devices accessible to the platform\&. An HDL platform has defined slot types; HDL cards that are designed for the same slot type can be plugged in to the defined slots on the platform\&.
.sp
An HDL slot is described by an OpenCPI HDL slot type definition, which is an XML file that defines the signal connections to the pins of the connectors associated with the slot type and provides an (optional) name for the slot type that can be used in HDL Platform Descriptions (OHPDs) and HDL card definitions\&. OpenCPI provides HDL slot definitions for a number of standard slot types, like the FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card), which is defined by the by the VITA standards organization as VITA\-57\&.1\&. Defining a new slot type for use in OpenCPI consists of defining an HDL slot type definition for it; writing HDL code to support an HDL slot is not normally necessary\&. For more information about the XML structure of an HDL slot type definition and how it relates to HDL platforms, devices and cards, see the section "Slots \- How Cards Plug into Platforms" in the \fIOpenCPI Platform Development Guide\fR\&.
.sp
In a project, an HDL slot resides in the \fBspecs/\fR subdirectory of the \fBhdl/cards/\fR subdirectory and is named \fI<name>\fR\fB\&.xml\fR, where \fI<name>\fR must be a name that can be used in programming languages (uses underscores rather than hyphens) but is otherwise case insensitive\&. The HDL slot name should normally be the exact name used in the standard document that defines the slot type\&.
.sp
Verbs that can operate on an HDL slot are:
.PP
\fBcreate\fR
.RS 4
Create the named HDL slot according to the specified options, creating directories and files as required\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdelete\fR
.RS 4
Remove all files associated with the named HDL slot\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
In the descriptions below, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates that it can be specified more than once on the command line\&.
.SS "Options That Apply to All Operations (Verbs) on Protocols"
.PP
\fB\-d\fR \fI<directory>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the directory in which the command should be run\&. Analogous to the
\fB\-C\fR
option in the POSIX
\fBmake\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Describe what is happening in command execution in more detail\&.
.RE
.SS "Options When Creating HDL Slots"
.PP
\fB\-k\fR
.RS 4
Keep files and directories created after an HDL slot creation fails\&. Normally, all such files and directories are removed on any failure\&.
.RE
.SS "Options When Deleting HDL Slots"
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting a protocol\&. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion\&.
.RE

Inside the project, create an HDL slot with the name
\fBmyslot\fR\&. The HDL slot definition named
\fBmyslot\&.xml\fR
will be placed in the subdirectory
\fBhdl/cards/specs/\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\

ocpidev create hdl card myslot

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
Inside the project, delete an HDL slot definition named
\fBmyslot\&.xml\fR
from a project\(cqs
\fBhdl/cards/specs/\fR
subdirectory:
.sp
.if n \{\
