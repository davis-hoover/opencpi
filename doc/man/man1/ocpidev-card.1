.SH "NAME"
ocpidev-card \- manage an OpenCPI HDL card\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBocpidev\fR [\fI<options>\fR] \fI<verb>\fR \fBhdl card\fR \fI<name>\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBhdl card\fR noun represents an OpenCPI HDL card, which defines a hardware component that contains devices and plugs into a \fIslot\fR on an HDL platform\&. Devices are either directly attached to the pins on an HDL platform or attached to cards that plug into compatible slots on the platform\&. Devices on a card are considered to be part of the card, which can be plugged into a certain type of slot on any platform, rather than part of the platform itself\&.
.sp
An HDL card is described by an HDL card definition, which is an XML file that describes the slot type of the card, the HDL devices (controlled by HDL device workers) that are present on the card, and how they are wired to the slot\&. There is no HDL code associated with an HDL card\&. For more information about the HDL card definition\(cqs XML structure and how it relates to HDL platforms, slots and HDL device workers, see the \fIOpenCPI Platform Development Guide\fR\&.
.sp
In a project, an HDL card resides in the \fBspecs/\fR subdirectory of the \fBhdl/cards/\fR subdirectory and is named \fI<name>\fR\fB\&.xml\fR\&. The HDL device workers that are specific to the card reside in the \fBhdl/cards/\fR subdirectory\&.
.sp
Verbs that can operate on an HDL card are:
.PP
\fBcreate\fR
.RS 4
Create the named HDL card according to the specified options, creating directories and files as required\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdelete\fR
.RS 4
Remove all files associated with the named HDL card\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
In the descriptions below, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates that it can be specified more than once on the command line\&.
.SS "Options That Apply to All Operations (Verbs) on HDL Cards"
.PP
\fB\-d\fR \fI<directory>\fR
.RS 4
Specify the directory in which the command should be run\&. Analogous to the
\fB\-C\fR
option in the POSIX
\fBmake\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Describe what is happening in command execution in more detail\&.
.RE
.SS "Options When Creating HDL Cards"
.PP
\fB\-k\fR
.RS 4
Keep files and directories created after an HDL card creation fails\&. Normally, all such files and directories are removed on any failure\&.
.RE
.SS "Options When Deleting HDL Cards"
.PP
\fB\-f\fR
.RS 4
Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting an HDL card\&. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

Inside the project, create an HDL card with the name
\fBmycard\fR\&. The HDL card definition named
\fBmycard\&.xml\fR
will be placed in the subdirectory
\fBhdl/cards/specs/\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
ocpidev create hdl card mycard

.if n \{\

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
Inside the project, delete an HDL card definition named
\fBmycard\&.xml\fR
from a project\(cqs
\fBhdl/cards/specs/\fR
subdirectory:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
