OCPIREMOTE(1)
============


NAME
----
ocpiremote - command-line tool for remotely managing an OpenCPI container server


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpiremote`* ['<options>'] ['<verb>' ['<options>']] 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`ocpiremote(1)`* command-line tool enables a local system
to load, start, and control a remote system, enabling it to act as an OpenCPI container server.
The target remote system requires network login via the Secure Shell (SSH),
the *`bash`* shell and the *`tar`* command.  It must be running an OpenCPI-supported software
(RCC) platform.  No additional installation is necessary since *`ocpiremote`* loads
OpenCPI software as needed.

The *`ocpiremote`* tool loads an *`ocpiserve`* executable
"package" over an SSH connection into a "sandbox" directory
(by default, *`~/sandbox`*) on the remote system
and can subsequently be used to start it. When started, *`ocpiserve`*
makes its local containers available to any and
all remote clients through the network interfaces
on the remote system. See the link:ocpiserve.1.html[ocpiserve(1)]
tool for details. The *`ocpiremote`* tool manages the container server
in the sandbox directory without affecting the rest of the remote system's
installation or configuration, providing a convenient way to set up and operate
container servers remotely.

The *`ocpiremote`* tool is part of OpenCPI's
*'remote containers'* feature, which adds containers
available in other (remote) systems on the network to the set
of containers considered when applications are executed on the local system.
See the chapter "Using Remote Containers: Network-Connected Processors"
in the 'OpenCPI Application Development Guide' for information
on how to set up and use this feature.

VERBS
-----
The *`ocpiremote`* command performs operations on the remote system
whose IP address and TCP port are listed first in
the *`OCPI_SERVER_ADDRESSES`* environment variable or whose
IP address and (optional) TCP port are specified as options
on the command line.

The verbs supported by *`ocpiremote`* are:

*`deploy`*::
    Copy an OpenCPI bootable media directory tree (also called
    a "deployment package" or "SD card contents") to the
    remote system (usually to a directory on an SD card inserted into that
    system) and reboot it. See the link:ocpiadmin.1.html[ocpiadmin(1)] tool for more
    information about creating bootable media directory
    trees for embedded systems.  This operation is not needed if the boot files are already suitable:  it is normally used to change operation system versions.
    This operation does not load OpenCPI files onto the remote system, just boot-up files to get the OS running.
    The *`--remote-dir`* option is used to specify the location of the boot directory
    on the remote system.  If *`--remote-dir`* is not specified, the boot directory will be
    determined heuristically, based on where a previous *`deploy`* operation was done.
*`load`*::
    Create a sandbox directory on the remote system and then place
    an *`ocpiserve`* container server package in that directory.  That package
    contains all necessary files to run *`ocpiserve`*.

*`log`*::
    Interactively view *`ocpiserve`* container server logging. If the server is not running,
    the log is displayed and the command finishes.  If the server is running the log is displayed
    continuously while the server is running, similar to the `*-f*` option to the *`tail*` command.

*`reboot`*::
    Reboot the remote system, usually used after the *`deploy`* operation.

*`reload`*::
    Delete an *`ocpiserve`* container server sandbox directory and then reload it.

*`restart`*::
    Stop and then start an *`ocpiserve`* container server on a remote system.

*`start`*::
    Start an *`ocpiserve`* container server on a remote system, which includes reloading
    any required kernel drivers and FPGA bitstreams (when the *`--bitstream--`* is specified.

*`status`*::
    Get the status of an *`ocpiserve`* container server on a remote system.

*`stop`*::
    Stop an *`ocpiserve`* container server on a remote system.

*`test`*::
    Test the basic connectivity between the local system
    and an *`ocpiserve`* container server on a remote system.

*`unload`*::
    Delete a container server sandbox directory.

None of these verbs take any arguments.

OPTIONS
-------

Options Common to All Operations on a Container Server or Remote System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These common options can be placed before the verb or after it.

*`--ip-addr=`*'<ip-address>', *`-i`* '<ip-address>'::
    Specify the IP address of the target remote system.
    If this option is not specified, the first IP address in the
    *`OCPI_SERVER_ADDRESSES`* environment variable is used.

*`--password=`*'<password>', *`-p`* '<password>'::
    Specify the password associated with the username used
    for login to the target remote system.
    The default password is *`root`*.

*`--remote-dir=`*'<directory-name>', *`-d`* '<directory-name>'::
    Except for the *`deploy`* verb, this specifies the name of a directory on the
    target remote system in which to create and use a container server sandbox.
    If this option is not used, the default directory
    name *`sandbox`* is created in the home directory
    of the specified user.
    With the *`deploy`* verb this specifies where the boot files are placed, and has no default.

*`--ssh-opts=`*'<options>', *`-o`* '<options>'::
    Specify the SSH options for connecting to the target remote system.
    If this option is not used, the default SSH options automatically
    accept host keys without notification and suppress
    most warning and diagnostic messages.

*`--scp-opts=`*'<options>', *`-c`* '<options>'::
    Specify the SCP options for connecting to the target remote system.
    If this option is not used, the default SCP options accept host keys without
    notification and suppress most warning and diagnostic messages.

*`--user=`*'<username>', *`-u`* '<username>'::
    Specify the username used for login to the target remote system.
    The default username is *`root`*.

*`--verbose`*, *`-v`*::
    Be verbose, printing additional information during command execution.

Options When Loading or Reloading a Container Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--hdl-platform=`*'<HDL-platform-identifier>'::
    Specify the HDL (FPGA) platform to be used by the container server on the target remote system.
    If this option is not
    used, the default is *`zed`*. See the 'OpenCPI User Guide'
    for the possible identifiers for OpenCPI HDL platforms.

*`--rcc-platform=`*'<RCC-platform-identifier>'::
    Specify the RCC (software) platform to be used by
    the container server on the target remote system.
    If this option is not
    used, the default is *`xilinx19_2_aarch32`*. See the 'OpenCPI User Guide'
    for the possible identifiers for OpenCPI RCC platforms.

*`--optimize`*::
    Specify that the software loaded should be what has been built with optimization enabled.
    The RCC platform must have already been built for optimization using the *`ocpiadmin`* or *`ocpidev`* commands
    with this same option.
    If this option is not
    used, the default is to use the unoptimized software perhaps better suited for debugging.

*`--port=`*'<tcp-port-number>', *`-r`* '<tcp-port-number>'::
    Specify the TCP port of the container server on the target remote system.
    If this option is not specified, the first port number in
    the *`OCPI_SERVER_ADDRESSES`* environment variable is used.

*`--valgrind`*::
    Specify that the files needed to run *`ocpiserve`* under the *`valgrind`* tool be included in the
    *`ocpiserve`* package. This requires that *`valgrind`* has been built as an OpenCPI prerequisite for the
    remote RCC software platform.

Options When Deploying OpenCPI Bootable Media Files to a Remote System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--remote-dir=`*'<directory-name>'::
    Specify the name of the directory on the target remote system where the boot files
    will be placed.

*`--hdl-platform`* and *`--rcc-platform`* as described above.

Options When Starting or Restarting a Container Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--bitstream`*, *`-b`*::
    Reload a test OpenCPI bitstream on the HDL platform (FPGA) prior to starting the server.
    On some systems this is needed to displace a non-OpenCPI bitstream that may have been
    preloaded at boot time.

*`--environment=`*'<value>', *`-e`*'<value>'::
    Specify environment variable settings that will be applied to *`ocpiserve`* when it is started.

*`--log-level=`*'<value>', *`-l`*'<value>'::
    Specify the OpenCPI log level to be used during
    container server execution.
    See the description of the OCPI_LOG_LEVEL environment
    variable in the 'OpenCPI User Guide' for a description
    of possible values. Using this option overrides the
    level set in the OCPI_LOG_LEVEL environment variable.
    The default log level is 0 (no logging).

*`--memory=`*'<value>', *`-m`*'<value>'::
    Specify the amount of DMA memory to use when *`ocpiserve`* is running.
    The value may be decimal, octal or hex (using 0x).  I.e. *`0x400000`* is 4 megabytes.

*`--valgrind`*::
    Specify that *`ocpiserve`* should be run under the valgrind tool.
    This requires that the same option was specified when the *`load`* or *`reload`* verb was used.
    The *`valgrind`* output will be in the log.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The following OpenCPI environment variables affect *`ocpiremote`* execution:

*`OCPI_SERVER_ADDRESSES`*::
    A comma- or space-separated list of IP addresses/TCP ports of remote systems to contact, where
    each IP/TCP address is in the format '<ip-address>'*`:`*'<tcp-port>'. For example,
    192.168.1.102:12345. When *`ocpiserve`* with the *`--verbose`* option is started, it prints its
    IP addresses/TCP ports in the log.

*`OCPI_SERVER_ADDRESSES_FILE`*::
    The name of a file that contains remote system IP addresses/TCP ports, one per line. Each
    IP address is in the format '<ip-address>'*`:`*'<tcp-port>'. For example,
    192.168.1.102:12345.

The chapter "Using Remote Containers: Network-Connected Processors" in
the 'OpenCPI Application Development Guide' provides more information
about when to use these environment variables and why.

EXAMPLES
---------
. Load an *`ocpiserve`* container server on the remote system
with IP address 192.168.1.102. The operation creates the
container server executable in the directory *`~/sandbox`*
+
-----------------------------------------
ocpiremote --ip-addr=192.168.1.102 load
-----------------------------------------
+
. Load and start an *`ocpiserve`* container server
on the remote system with IP address 192.168.1.102 and port 12345
using the environment variable that will apply to all *`ocpiremote`* commands.
Before starting the server, establish 4 megabytes of DMA memory, and load an OpenCPI bitstream
on top of whatever is currently loaded.
+
-----------------------------------------
export OCPI_SERVER_ADDRESSES=192.168.1.102:12345
ocpiremote load --rcc-platform=xilinx19_2_aarch32 --hdl-platform=e31x
ocpiremote start --bitstream --memory 0x400000
-----------------------------------------
+
. Stop the *`ocpiserve`* container server on the remote system
with IP address 192.168.1.102:
+
-----------------------------------------
ocpiremote --ip-addr=192.168.1.102 stop
-----------------------------------------
+
. Observe logging on the *`ocpiserve`* container server
on the remote system with IP address 192.168.1.102:
+
-----------------------------------------
ocpiremote --ip-addr=192.168.1.102 log
-----------------------------------------
+
. Load an *`ocpiserve`* container server into the *`~/myserver/`*
directory on the remote system listed
first in the OCPI_SERVER_ADDRESSES environment variable:
+
-----------------------------------------
ocpiremote --remote-dir=myserver load
-----------------------------------------
+
. Delete and then load an *`ocpiserve`* container server
on the remote system with the IP address 192.168.1.102
and the TCP port 9233:
+
-----------------------------------------------------
ocpiremote --ip-addr=192.168.1.102 --port=9233 reload
-----------------------------------------------------
