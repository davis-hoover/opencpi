OCPIDEV-PLATFORM(1)
==================


NAME
----
ocpidev-platform - manage an OpenCPI HDL platform.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`hdl platform`* '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`hdl platform`* noun represents an OpenCPI HDL platform, which is
either a specific FPGA part on a circuit board with optionally attached
devices or an FPGA simulator that has the infrastructure to serve
as an OpenCPI 'container' (runtime environment) for
'HDL assemblies' (FPGA-based subsets of OpenCPI applications).

An HDL platform is described by an OpenCPI HDL Platform Description (OHPD),
which is an XML file that specifies:

- The worker description file (OWD) for the 'HDL platform worker', which
is a special type of device worker that contains the logic for running the HDL platform

- The devices that are attached to the HDL platform and are available for use

In a project, an HDL platform resides in its own directory '<name>' (which is
usually the lowercase version of the name used by the platform's vendor)
under a *`platforms/`* subdirectory in the project's *`hdl/`* directory.

An HDL platform directory contains the platform's OHPD (named '<name>'*`.xml`*),
its "make" file (named *`Makefile`*) and the VHDL source code skeleton file
'<name>'*`.vhd`* for the HDL platform worker.
The *`ocpidev create`* operation for an HDL platform produces
initial versions of these files that can then be edited as necessary.

An HDL platform directory can also optionally contain:

- Device workers that are unique to the HDL platform, in a *`devices/`* library

- XML files that specify different configurations of the devices
that are available on the HDL platform, called 'platform configuration files'

- Vendor FPGA 'constraints' files for use with a specific platform configuration
instead of the default configuration for the platfor

- File(s) that specify vendor tool build-time options

The *`ocpidev build`* operation generates exported files that enable HDL
assemblies to be built for the platform and a *`/lib`* subdirectory
that contains links to the files that are necessary for other OpenCPI
assets to use the platform. Note that building a OpenCPI platform (whether
HDL or RCC) is usually done at installation time because a platform
cannot be used by other OpenCPI assets until it has been built.
See the 'OpenCPI Installation Guide' for a description of how OpenCPI
platforms are built.

For information on the HDL build flow as it relates to HDL platforms
and other HDL assets, see the chapter "Building HDL Assets" in the
'OpenCPI HDL Development Guide'. 

For information on developing an HDL platform, including structure and syntax
descriptions of HDL platform/platform worker and HDL platform configuration XML
files and how to develop a device worker, see the section "Enabling Execution for
FPGA Platforms" in the 'OpenCPI Platform Development Guide'.

Verbs that can operate on an HDL platform are:

*`build`*::
    Build the HDL platform, creating directories and files
    as required.

*`clean`*::
    Remove all the generated and compiled files for all assets
    in the HDL platform.
    
*`create`*::
    Create the named HDL platform, creating files and directories as required.
    
*`delete`*::
    Remove all directories and files associated with the named HDL platform.
    
*`utilization`*::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the HDL platform.

Note that an asset's name is implied by the directory you're in when
you issue the *`ocpidev`* command. For HDL platforms, this
means that you can perform operations (verbs) on the HDL platform
without having to specify its name when you issue the
*`ocpidev`* command from inside the HDL platform's directory.

The *`ocpidev`* tool can also operate on a plural *`hdl platforms`* noun.
The syntax is:

*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] [*`build|clean|show|utilization`*] *`hdl platforms`*

The verbs that can be performed on the *`hdl platforms`* noun are:

*`build`*::
    Build all of the HDL platforms in the project or the *`/hdl`*
    subdirectory of the project [??Does it operate on the hdl subdirectory?], creating directories and files as required.
    
*`clean`*::
    Remove all the generated and compiled files from all HDL platforms
    in the project or the *`/hdl`* subdirectory of the project [correct?].

*`show`*::
    List all HDL platforms in all registered projects and the current project.
    The general-purpose options and the *`show`* formatting options
    can be specified.
    
*`utilization`*::
    Display FPGA resource usage information for all built HDL platforms
    in the project. The general-pupose options and the *`utilization`*
    options [???all of them??] can be specified.

OPTIONS
-------
In the descriptions below, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates
that it can be specified more than once on the command line.

Keywords for platforms supported by OpenCPI that can be
specified in the '<platform>' argument to an option
can be found in the tables of supported platforms in the 'OpenCPI User Guide'.

Keywords for architectures supported by OpenCPI that can be specified
in the '<target>' argument to an option include *`isim`*, *`modelsim`*,
*`xsim`*, *`stratix4`*, *`stratix5`*, *`virtex5`*, *`virtex6`*, *`zynq`*,
*`zynq_is`*, *`spartan3adsp`*.

Options That Apply to All Operations (Verbs) on HDL Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   
*`-d`* '<directory>'::
    Specify the directory in which the command should be run.
    Analogous to the *-C* option in the POSIX *make* command.
    
*`-v, --verbose`*::
    Describe what is happening in command execution in more detail.

Options When Creating HDL Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
*`-A`* '<directory>'+::
    Specify a directory to search for XML include files.

*`-C`* '<core>'+::
    Specify an HDL primitive core on which the HDL platform
    (or assets it contains) depends and with which it should be built.

*`-I`* '<directory>'+::
    Specify a directory to search for include files (C, C++,
    Verilog).

*`-T`* '<target>'+::
    Only build the HDL platform for the specified HDL architecture.

*`-Y`* '<primitive-library>'+::
    Specify a primitive library on which the HDL platform (or assets
    it contains) depends.  
   
*`-Z`* '<target>'+::
    Do not build the HDL platform for the specified HDL architecture.
   
*`-k`*::
    Keep files and directories created after an HDL platform creation
    fails. Normally, all such files and directories are removed
    on any failure.

*`-y`* '<component-library>'+::
    Specify a component library to search for workers, devices
    and/or specs referenced by one or more assets in the created HDL platform.

Options When Deleting HDL Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-f`*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    an HDL platform. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.

Options When Building HDL Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--hdl-target=`*'<target>'+::
    Build the HDL platform(s) for the specified HDL target. If only HDL targets
    are specified (and no HDL platforms), containers are not built.

*`--hdl-platform=`*'<hdl-platform>'+::
    Build the HDL platform(s) for the specified HDL platform.

Options When Showing HDL Platforms (plural noun only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--global-scope`*::
    Show HDL platforms from all registered projects and the
    current project if applicable.
    This is the default scope used if *`--local-scope`* is not used.

*`--json`*::
    Format the output in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format
    for integration with other software.

*`--local-scope`*:: 
    Only display information about the local HDL platform.

*`--simple`*::
    Format the output as simply as possible.

*`--table`*::
    Display the output in an easy-to-read table.
    This is the default display format
    used if *--simple* or *--json* are not used.
    
Options When Using Utilization on HDL Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--format=`*{*`table`*|*`latex`*}::
    Specify the format in which to output the FPGA resource usage information.
    Specifying *`table`* sends the information to stdout in tabular format.
    Specifying *`latex`* bypasses *`stdout`* and writes all output to
    *`utilization.inc`* files in the directories for the assets on
    which it operates.
    
*`--hdl-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the built HDL platforms
    on the specified HDL platform. (???This and the others below don't make sense.
    Is it "the built assets in the HDL platform" that usage info is generated for?)

*`--hdl-library=`*'<library>'::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the built
    HDL platforms in the specified HDL library.

*`--library=`*'<library>', *`-l`* '<library>'::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the built
