NAME
----
ocpidev-device - manage an OpenCPI HDL device worker.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`hdl device`* '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`hdl device`* noun represents an OpenCPI HDL device worker,
which is a special type of HDL application worker designed to
support specific external hardware attached to an HDL platform
or card, such as an ADC, flash memory or I/O device.

While an application worker is a component implementation
that requires only abstracted data interfaces, an HDL device worker
is an HDL component implementation written to the HDL authoring
model that directly controls and attaches to a physical
device. An HDL device worker generally implements
the device manufacturer's data sheet, providing access
and visibility to the device's native registers and capabilities.
HDL device workers allow OpenCPI to use the devices attached
to an HDL platform and are developed as part of enabling an
HDL platform for OpenCPI. The 'OpenCPI Platform Development Guide'
provides details on how to develop an HDL device worker.

An HDL device worker can be supported by:

- A 'device proxy' worker, which is an RCC worker written in C++ that
is specifically paired with the HDL device worker to provide a higher-
level and more generic interface to the HDL device worker's low-level one.
The purpose of a device proxy worker is to make a device look more like others
in its class, providing more user- and software-friendly access and
visibility to the device's capabilities. The 'OpenCPI RCC Development Guide'
describes how to develop a proxy worker.

- A 'device emulator' worker, which is a specialized HDL device worker
that emulates a device for test purposes. A device emulator worker
provides the mirror image of the HDL device worker's external signals
so that it can can emulate the device in simulation. The 'OpenCPI
Platform Development Guide' describes how to develop an HDL device emulator
worker.

- A 'subdevice' worker, which is a specialized HDL device worker
that enables multiple HDL device workers to share some underlying
hardware, like shared resets, shared SPI or I2C buses. They also
allow device workers to stay portable when low-level modules
differ by HDL platform or card. The 'OpenCPI
Platform Development Guide' describes how to develop an HDL subdevice
worker.

These support workers can be HDL platform-independent or HDL platform-specific.

An HDL device worker (and its support workers) are OpenCPI workers and
are thus described by an OpenCPI Worker Description (OWD). For an
HDL device worker:

- The component specification (OCS) that the worker implements usually
represents a specific type of device but can be an OpenCPI-defined "device
class" component spec (for example, *`clock_gen-spec`*) and must be
the OpenCPI-defined *`emulator-spec`* if the OWD describes
an HDL device emulator worker. The OpenCPI-defined OCSes are located in
the top-level *`specs/`* directory of the *`core`* project.

- The language used for the source code is VHDL.

- Signal connections with the hardware attached to the pins
of the HDL platform (FPGA) are defined for the HDL device
worker in addition to any port and property definitions.
Signal connections defined in HDL subdevice worker OWDs
are to pins that are shared between the HDL device workers that the
HDL subdevice worker supports. Signal connections are not defined
in emulator device worker OWDs because an HDL emulator device
automatically inherits the signal connections from the device
worker it emulates.

An HDL subdevice worker OWD also specifies the device
worker(s) that the HDL subdevice worker supports and how it connects
to each supported HDL device worker.

The 'OpenCPI Platform Development Guide' provides more information
about the XML structure of HDL device worker, subdevice
worker and emulator worker OWDs, while the 'OpenCPI HDL Development Guide'
provides information about the XML structure of an HDL worker OWD.

In a project, an HDL device worker resides in its own directory
'<name>'*`.hdl`* and can be located in the following places
depending on its intended use:

- In the platform-generic HDL device library at
*`hdl/devices/`*. This library contains HDL device workers
that can be used on different HDL platforms and cards.
It can also contain RCC-based HDL device proxy workers, HDL
subdevice workers and HDL device emulator workers for one
or more HDL device workers in the library.

- In a platform-specific HDL device library at
*`platforms/`*'<hdl-platform>'*`/devices/`*.
This library contains HDL device workers, proxies,
subdevices and emulators that function only on that platform.

- In the directory *`hdl/cards/`*. This subdirectory
contains HDL device workers, proxies, subdevices and emulators
that are specific to or can only be used on cards,
rather than those that are generally useful on
different platforms and cards.

An OpenCPI HDL device worker asset document can also be created for
an HDL assembly to facilitate documenting the HDL device worker during
the overall HDL device worker development process.
In a project, an HDL device worker asset document resides in
the same directory and has the same name as the HDL device worker's
OWD but with the suffix *`.rst`* instead of *`.xml`*. Unless suppressed
by options, building the HDL device worker or the asset that contains
it builds viewable HTML output of the HDL device worker asset document
and cleaning the HDL device worker removes the generated HTML.
The section "Documenting OpenCPI Assets" in the
'OpenCPI Documentation Writer Guide' provides more information about
this feature and describes how to create an OpenCPI HDL device worker asset document.

Verbs that can operate on an HDL device worker are:

*`build`*::
    Compile the HDL device worker source code and asset document,
    creating files and directories as required. Use the *`--doc-only`*
    and *`--no-doc`* options to control the asset document building function.
    
*`clean`*::
    Remove all generated and compiled files for the HDL device worker.
    Use the *`--doc-only`* and *`--no-doc`* options to control
    the asset document cleaning function.

*`create`*::
    Create the named HDL device worker, creating files and directories as required.

*`delete`*::
    Remove all directories and files associated with the named HDL device worker.

Note that the *`utilization`* verb can be used with the *`worker`* noun to display
an HDL device worker's FPGA usage statistics. See link:ocpidev-worker.1.html[ocpidev-worker(1)]
for more information.

Within the HDL device worker's directory are the
OWD (named '<name>'*`.xml`*) and its primary source code file (named
'<name>'*`.vhd`*. The *`ocpidev create`* operation produces initial versions
of these files that can then be edited as necessary to produce the HDL device
worker implementation.

The *`ocpidev build`* operation for an HDL device worker creates additional
files in the worker's directory, such as architecture-independent source code
and XML files, in a directory named *`gen`*, viewable HTML output from the
HDL device worker document, in the subdirectory *`gen/doc`*, and architecture-specific object
and binary files for the compilation target being built, in a directory named
*`target-`*'<hdl-platform>'; for example, *`target-zed`* or *`target-xsim`*.
These are the files that the *`ocpidev clean`* operation removes.

Note that an asset's name is implied by the directory you're in when
you issue the *`ocpidev`* command. For HDL device workers, this means that you can
perform operations (verbs) on the HDL device worker without having to specify its
name when you issue the *`ocpidev`* command from inside the HDL device worker directory.
