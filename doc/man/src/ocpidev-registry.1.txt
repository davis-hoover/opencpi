OCPIDEV-REGISTRY(1)
==================


NAME
----
ocpidev-registry - manage an OpenCPI project registry.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`registry`* ['<name>']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`registry`* noun represents an OpenCPI project registry, which is a
directory that contains references to OpenCPI projects.
An OpenCPI project registry is a way to manage project interdependencies.
A project is  automatically 'associated' with a registry when it is created,
allowing it to view and depend on other projects registered there.
A project can also be 'registered' in its associated project
registry, allowing it to be visible to other projects associated there.
Projects are not initially registered; the *`ocpidev register`* operation
for a project can be used to register them.

The OpenCPI installation provides a default project registry at
$OCPI_ROOT_DIR/project-registry. However, in some project development
environments, it can be useful to have an additional "sandbox" project
registry for use as an alternative to the OpenCPI default.

The OpenCPI environment variable *`OCPI_PROJECT_REGISTRY_DIR`* can
be set to point to an alternative project registry; setting this
variable allows subsequently created projects to be associated
with this registry and not with the OpenCPI default.

For more information about project registries and how to manage them,
see the section "The Project Registry: How Projects Depend on
and Find Each Other" in the 'OpenCPI Component Development Guide'.

Verbs that can operate on a project registry are:
    
*`create`*::
    Create the named project registry at the specified location.
    
*`delete`*::
    Remove the named project registry from the specified location.

*`set`*::
    Manually associate a project with a project registry.
    
*`show`*::
    Display a list of projects registered with a project registry and their locations.
    
*`unset`*::
    Manually remove the association between a project and a project registry.

OPTIONS
-------
In the descriptions below, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates
that it can be specified more than once on the command line.

Options That Apply to All Operations (Verbs) on Registries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-d`* '<directory>'::
    Specify the directory in which the command should be run.
    Analogous to the *-C* option in the POSIX *make* command.
    
*`-v`*, *`--verbose`*::
    Describe what is happening in command execution in more detail.

Options When Creating and Setting Registries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-d`* '<directory>'::
    Specify the path to the registry being created or set.
    
Options When Deleting Registries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-f`*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    a project registry. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.

Options When Showing Registries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--json`*::
    Format the output in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format
    for integration with other software.

*`--global-scope`*::
    Display information about all project registries.
    This is the default scope used if *`-local-scope`* is not used.

*`--local-scope`*:: 
    Only display information about the local project registry.

*`--simple`*::
    Format the output as simply as possible.

*`--table`*::
    Display the output in an easy-to-read table.
    This is the default display format
    used if *--simple* or *--json* are not used.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Create a registry *`~/workspace/my-registry`*. Note that this registry will
not have the *`core`* project registered, so you must locate and register
the core project in *`my-registry`* after creating it.
+
--------------------------------------------------
ocpidev create registry my-registry -d ~/workspace
--------------------------------------------------
+
. Display information about the projects in the current registry:
+
----------------------
ocpidev show registry
----------------------
+
. Inside the project, associate the project with the default registry:
+
---------------------
ocpidev set registry
--------------------
. Inside the project, associate the project with the registry named
*`my-registry`* located at ~/workspace/:
+
-----------------------------------------------
ocpidev -d ~/workspace set registry my-registry
-----------------------------------------------
+
. Inside the project, remove the association between the project
and a registry. The next time the project is built, the default
project registry will be used:
+
---------------------
ocpidev unset registry
---------------------
