SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpigui`* ['<options>'] '<verb>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*Note*: this command is not currently implemented, but will be in a future release.

The *`ocpigui(1)`* command-line tool is used to start the OpenCPI
graphical user interface (GUI) for managing OpenCPI assets.

The OpenCPI GUI is a front end to *`ocpidev(1)`* that can perform most, but not all, of the
development tasks that *`ocpidev`* can perform from within a graphical user interface.

Installing OpenCPI GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OpenCPI GUI is an optional OpenCPI development tool; the 'OpenCPI Installation Guide' provides
instructions on how to install it.

Using OpenCPI GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'OpenCPI GUI User Guide' describes the GUI's menus and dialogs. The OpenCPI
tutorials demonstrate how to use the OpenCPI GUI to perform OpenCPI development
tasks.

VERBS

The verbs supported by *`ocpigui`* are:

*`desktop`*::
    Add a selection for starting OpenCPI GUI
    to the Applications > Programming menu bar on a CentOS7 development host [???Can it be any development host???].

*`gui.desktop`*::
    The file that adds a menu selection for the OpenCPI GUI
    tool to the Applications > Programming desktop environment

    home directory in the subdirectory *`local/share/applications/`*.
    [???Can this be genericized to support ubuntu as well as centos7?]
