NAME
----
ocpidev-unset - manually disassociate a project from a registry.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ocpidev* ['<options>'] *unset registry*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Projects are automatically associated with the current
registry when they are created or used. A project can
be manually associated with or disassociated
from a particular registry. Use the *ocpidev unset registry*
command to remove an association between a project
and a registry.

You must run this command from within a project.

Asset types to be specified in the '<noun>' argument are:

*registry*::
    Unset the registry for the project.

OPTIONS
-------
You can use the general-purpose options *`-v`* and *`-d`* '<directory>'
with this command. In particular, you can use the *`-d`* '<directory>'
option to specify the pathname of the project whose registry should
be unset. If this option is not specified, the current project is used.

There are no verb-specific options.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Unset the registry associated with the current project. The next time the project
is built, the default registry will be used.

ocpidev unset registry

. Unset the registry associated with the project *`~/MyProject`*.
The next time the project is built, the default registry will be used.
