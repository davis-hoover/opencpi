OCPIDEV-PROJECT(1)
=================


NAME
----
ocpidev-project - manage an OpenCPI project.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`project`* '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`project`* noun represents an OpenCPI project that holds and
organizes OpenCPI assets. A project is a workspace in a directory
where assets are developed. A project can contain:

- Component libraries with component specifications, component unit
test suites and workers (described in the 'OpenCPI Component Development Guide')

- Applications (described in the 'OpenCPI Application Development Guide')

- HDL primitives and HDL assemblies (described in the 'OpenCPI
HDL Development Guide')

- HDL devices, cards and slots (described in the 'OpenCPI HDL
Development Guide')

- Platform support assets (described in the 'OpenCPI Platform
Development Guide')

A project has:

- A defined directory structure for storing assets
in both source and built forms

- A project XML file (named *`Project.xml`*)
that defines attributes for the project and some others to be applied to all
assets in the project

- An optional export file (named *`Project.exports`*)
that specifies the assets and files that are to be visible
to other projects that use this project's assets

The *`ocpidev create`* operation produces a skeleton directory
structure and initial versions of the files
that can then be edited as necessary during project
and asset development.

For details on project directory structure and how
it is populated and built, see the chapter "Developing OpenCPI
Assets in Projects" in the 'OpenCPI Component Development
Guide'.

Verbs that can operate on a project are:

*`build`*::
    Build all assets in the project.

*`clean`*::
    Remove all the generated and compiled files for all assets
    in the project.

*`create`*::
    Create the named project, creating files and directories as required.
    The project is created in a directory '<name>', which must be a name
    without slashes. The project directory is created under the current
    working directory where *`ocpidev`* is executed. The general-purpose
    option *`-d`* '<directory>' can be used to create the
    project's directory under a different directory.

*`delete`*::
    Remove all directories and files associated with the named project.

*`refresh`*::
    Manually regenerate the metadata associated with the project.

*`run`*::
    Run all applications and unit test suites in the project.
    
*`show`*::
    Display information associated with the project.

*`[un]register`*::
    Register/unregister the named project in a registry.

*`utilization`*::
    Display usage information for all built workers, platforms,
    and assemblies contained in the project.

Note that an asset's name is implied by the directory you're in when
you issue the *`ocpidev`* command. For projects, this means that you can
perform operations (verbs) on the project without having to specify its
name when you issue the *`ocpidev`* command from inside the project directory.

The *`ocpidev`* tool can also operate on a plural *`projects`* noun.
The syntax is:

*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] *`show projects`*

where *`show`* is the only valid verb, the default global
scope is the only valid scope, and the valid options
are *`-d`* '<directory>' and the *`show`* verb formatting
options (*`--json`*, *`--simple`*, *`--table`*).
The *`ocpidev show projects`* command displays
information about all registered OpenCPI projects.

OPTIONS
-------
In the descriptions below, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates
that it can be specified more than once on the command line.

Options That Apply to All Operations (Verbs) on Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-d`* '<directory>'+::
    Specify the directory in which the command should be run.
    Analogous to the *-C* option in the POSIX *make* command.

*`-v`*, *`--verbose`*+::
    Describe what is happening in command execution in more detail.

Options When Creating Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--exclude-platform=`*'<platform>', *`-Q`* '<platform>'+::
   Do not build the project for the specified platform.

*`--only-platform=`*'<platform>', *-G* '<platform>'+::
   Only build the project for the specified platform.
   
*`--register`*::
   Register the project as part of creating it.   

*`-A`* '<directory>'+::
   Specify a directory to search for XML include files.
   
*`-D`* '<package-ID>'+::
    Specify the package-ID of a project on which the project being
    created depends.

*`-F`* '<package-prefix>'::
   Specify the package prefix of the created project. The default
   is *local* for projects.

*`-I`* '<directory>'+::
   Specify a directory to search for include files (C, C++,
   Verilog).

*`-K`* '<package-ID>'::
   Specify the package-ID directly. The default is
   '<package-prefix>'*.*'<package-name>'.

*-N* '<package-name>'::
   Specify the package name of the created project. The
   default is the '<name>' argument given after the *`create`* verb.
   
*`-T`* '<target>'+::
   Only build the project for the specified architecture.

*`-Y`* '<primitive-library>'+::
   Specify a primitive library on which the project (or assets
   it contains) depends.
   
*`-Z`* '<target>'+::
   Do not build the project for the specified architecture.

*`-k`*::
    Keep files and directories created after a project creation
    fails. Normally, all such files and directories are removed
    on any failure.

*`-y`* '<component-library>'+::
   Specify a component library to search for workers, devices
   and/or specs that this project (or assets it contains) references.

Options When Deleting Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-f`*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    a project. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.

Options When Building Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--hdl-assembly=`*'<hdl-assembly>'+::
    Limit the HDL assemblies being built to the specified assembly. This option
    can also be used in the *hdl/assemblies* directory.

*`--hdl`*::
    Limit the assets being built to HDL primitives, workers, platforms
    or assemblies.

*`--hdl-platform=`*'<hdl-platform>'+::
    Build HDL assets for the specified HDL platform.

*`--hdl-rcc-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Build RCC/ACI assets for the RCC platforms associated with the
    specified HDL platform. If this option is not used (and *`--rcc-platform`*
    '<platform>' is also not used), the current development software
    platform is used as the single RCC platform used for building.

*`--hdl-target=`*'<target>'+::
    Build HDL assets for the specified HDL architecture. If only HDL targets
    are specified (and no HDL platforms), containers are not
    built for HDL assemblies or component unit test suites.
    
*`--no-assemblies`*::
    Don't build the HDL assemblies in the project. Building HDL assemblies
    (and their containers) can be slow.

*`--rcc`*::
    Limit the assets being built to RCC workers.

*`--rcc-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Build RCC/ACI assets for the specified RCC platform. If this
    option is not used (and *`--hdl-rcc-platform`* '<platform>'
    is also not used), the current development software platform
    is used as the single RCC platform used for building.

*`--optimimize`*::
    Build RCC/ACI assets with compiler optimization enabled.  This
    results in a separate set of build outputs that do not conflict
    with non-optimized (debug) build outputs, since they are placed
    in a target directory whose name has a "-o" suffix.

*`--worker=`*'<worker>'+::
    Limits the assets being built to the specified worker.

Options When Running Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The options described here, when used in an "ocpidev run project" command,
are applied as appropriate to all of the runnable assets (applications
and unit test suites) that reside in the project. Note that any application-specific
options supplied on the command line are only applied to XML applications
and not to ACI applications.

Options That Apply to Applications and Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*`--rcc-platform=`*'<platform>'+:: 
    Specify the RCC platform to use to build and generate the unit test suites
    and build the ACI applications.

Options That Apply to Applications Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   
*`--after=`*'<args>'+::
    Specify the argument(s) to insert at the end of the execution command line.
    
*`--before=`*'<args>'+:: 
    Specify the argument(s) to insert before the ACI executable or
    the *`ocpirun`* command; for example, environment settings
    or prefix commands.
	
*`--run-arg=`*'<args>'+::
    Specify the argument(s) to insert immediately after the ACI executable or
    the *`ocpirun`* command.

For details on how to use these options, see the section "Applications
in Projects" in the 'OpenCPI Application Development Guide'.

Options That Apply to Component Unit Test Suites Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*`--accumulate-errors`*:: 
    Report execution or verification errors as they occur rather
    than ending the test on the first failure detected.
    
*`--exclude-platform=`*'<platform>', *`-Q`* '<platform>'+::
    Specify the runtime platform to omit from a unit test suite.
    
*`--hdl-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Specify the HDL platform to use with the unit test suite. This option is only
    valid in generate and build phases.

*`--keep-simulations`*:: 
    Keep HDL simulation files regardless of verification results.
    By default, simulation files are removed if the verification
    is successful. Warning: Simulation files can become large!
    
*`--mode=`*'<mode>'[,'<mode>'[,'<mode>'...]]::
    Specify which phase(s) of the unit test to execute. Valid modes are:
    - *`all`*:  execute all five phases (the default if *`--mode`* is not used)
    - *`gen`*: execute generate phase
    - *`gen_build`*: execute generate and build phases
    - *`prep_run_verify`*: execute prepare, run, and verify phases
    - *`prep`*: execute prepare phase
    - *`run`*: execute run phase
    - *`prep_run`*: execute prepare and run phases
    - *`verify`*: execute verify phase 
    - *`view`*: execute the view script (view.sh) on an already executed run  
    - *`clean_all`*: clean all generated files
    - *`clean_run`*: clean all files generated during the run phase   
    
*`--only-platform=`*'<platform>', *`-G`* '<platform>'+:: 
    Specify the runtime platform to use with a unit test suite.

*`--remotes=`*'<system>'::
    Specify the remote system to run the unit test suite(s) by setting the
    *`OCPI_REMOTE_TEST_SYS`* variable. See the section
    "Defining Remote Systems for Executing Tests"
    in the 'OpenCPI Component Development Guide' for more information.
    
*`--view`*::
    Run the view script (*`view.sh`*) for the test at the conclusion of the
    test's execution.

*`-l`* '<library>'::
    Run the unit test suite(s) in the specified library.

Options When Showing Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--global-scope`*::
   Show assets from all registered projects and the
   current project if applicable.
   This is the default scope used if *`-local-scope`* is not used.
    
*`--json`*::
    Format the output in json format, for integration with other software.

*`--local-scope`*::
   Only show assets in the local project.

*`--simple`*::
    Format the output as simply as possible.
  
*`--table`*::
    Display the output in an easy-to-read table.
    This is the default display format
    used if *`--simple`* or *`--json`* are not used.

Options When Using Utilization on Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--format`*{*`=table`*|*`latex`*}::
    Specify the format in which to output the usage information.
    Specifying *`table`* sends the information to stdout in tabular format.
    Specifying *`latex`* bypasses *`stdout`* and writes all output to
    *`utilization.inc`* files in the directories for the assets on
    which it operates.
    
*`--hdl-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Specify the buildable HDL platform for which to
    display usage information.
    This option can be specified more than once on the command line.
