NAME
----
ocpidriver - command-line utility for managing the OpenCPI
loadable Linux kernel module driver


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidriver`* '<verb>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`ocpidriver`* tool controls the OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver
on an 'OpenCPI system':
a collection of processors that can be used together as resources for
running OpenCPI applications. Whether or not the Linux kernel module
driver is required depends on the 'platforms' (processors and their
directly-connected hardware) enabled for use by OpenCPI during
application execution and the 'interconnect' technology that wires them
together: the driver is necessary for access by OpenCPI to platforms
connected to a system bus (such as PCI-Express or
the Zynq FPGA subsystem) but is not needed on systems that do
not have such a bus or fabric. Developers use the *`ocpidriver`* tool
to load and control the driver when it is required for running OpenCPI on a system.

The OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver uses DMA memory for communication
with platforms via the system bus. By default, Linux allocates
128KB of DMA memory for the OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver.
The OpenCPI "getting started guides" for the relevant platforms
attached to the system bus (for example,
the 'ML605 Getting Started Guide' and the 'Alst4 Getting Started Guide')
describe how to reserve additional DMA memory for the driver
when OpenCPI applications require it.

VERBS
-----
The verbs supported by *`ocpidriver`* are:

*`load`*::
    Load an OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver to a system.
    
*`reload`*::
    Remove an OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver from a system and then load it.

*`status`*::
    Get the status of an OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver on a system.

*`unload`*::
    Remove an OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver from a system.

Performing these operations requires *`root`*/*`sudo`* privileges.

NOUNS
-----
None.

OPTIONS
-------
None.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Using the *`root`* account, load the OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver
on a system that has the Altera Stratix IV (*`alst4`*) and Xilinx (*`ml605`*) PCI-Express
platforms installed and which has reserved an additional 128KB of DMA memory for the driver:
+
---------------
ocpidriver load
---------------
+
On success, the tool generates the following message:
+
----------------------------------------------------------------
Found generic reserved DMA memory on the linux boot command line
and assuming it is for OpenCPI: [memmap=128M$0x1000000]
Driver loaded successfully.
----------------------------------------------------------------
+
Now perform the command:
+
--------------
ocpirun --list
--------------
+
The output from the command is:
+
-------------------------------------------------------
Available containers:
   #  Model Platform   OS    OS-Version   Arch   Name
   0  hdl   ml605                                PCI:0000:08:00.0

   2  rcc   centos7    linux c7           x86_64 rcc0
-------------------------------------------------------
+
. Unload the OpenCPI Linux kernel module driver:
+
------------------
ocpidriver unload
------------------
+
On success, the tool returns the message:
+
--------------------------------------------
The driver module was successfully unloaded.
