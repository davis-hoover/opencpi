OCPIDEV-SET(1)
==============


NAME
----
ocpidev-set - manually associate the current project with a registry.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ocpidev* ['<options>'] *set registry* ['<directory>']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Projects are automatically associated with the current registry
when they are created or used. Use the *ocpidev set registry* command
to manually associate the current project with a particular registry.
You must run this command from within a project. The optional '<directory>'
argument specifies the registry's directory path. When used without
the '<directory>' argument, the command sets the current project's
registry to the default registry.

Asset types to be specified in the '<noun>' argument are:

*registry*::
    Set the registry for the current project.

OPTIONS
-------
You can use the general-purpose options *`-v`* and *`-d`* '<directory>'
with this command. In particular, you can use the *`-d`* '<directory>'
option to specify the pathname of the registry being set.

There are no verb-specific options.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Set the current project's registry to the default:
+
----------------------
ocpidev set registry
----------------------
+
. Set the current project's registry to the directory
named *`-my-registry`* located at *`~/workspace/`*:
+
----------------------------------------------
ocpidev -d ~/workspace set registry my-registry
----------------------------------------------
