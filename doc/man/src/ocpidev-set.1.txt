OCPIDEV-SET(1)
==============


NAME
----
ocpidev-set - manually associate a project with a registry.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ocpidev* ['<options>'] *set registry* ['<directory>']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Projects are automatically associated with the current registry
when they are created or used. Use the *ocpidev set registry* command
to manually associate a project with a particular registry.
You must run this command from within a project. The optional '<directory>'
argument specifies the registry's directory path. When used without
the '<directory>' argument, the command sets the project's
registry to the default registry.

Asset types to be specified in the '<noun>' argument are:

*registry*::
    Set the registry for the project.

OPTIONS
-------
You can use the general-purpose options *`-v`* and *`-d`* '<directory>'
with this command. In particular, you can use the *`-d`* '<directory>'
option to specify the pathname of the project whose registry should be set.
If this option is not specified, the current project is used.

There are no verb-specific options.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Set the current project's registry to the default:
+
---------------------
ocpidev set registry
---------------------
+
. Set the registry for the project *`~/myproject`* to the registry
*`~/my-registry2`*:
+
--------------------------------------------------
ocpidev -d ~/myproject set registry ~/my-registry2
--------------------------------------------------
