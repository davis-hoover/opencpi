OCPIVIEW(1)
==========


NAME
----
ocpiview - command-line tool for viewing the results of simulation
runs on HDL (FPGA) simulator platforms


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpiview`* ['<options>'] ['<directory>']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`ocpiview`* tool displays the results of a simulation run
on an HDL (FPGA) simulator platform using
the simulation viewer provided by the simulator platform
associated with that run.
OpenCPI application developers generally run *`ocpiview`* after
application execution if they need
to examine the simulation results in detail. OpenCPI component
developers can also use *`ocpiview`* to examine the results of component unit test
executions on simulator platforms.

In a project, the results of FPGA simulator runs for OpenCPI applications
reside in the the *`simulations/`* subdirectory of the *`applications/`* directory.
Each time a simulator runs under *`ocpirun`* (or *`ocpidev run`* with the
*`--keep-simulations`* option), it
executes in a new subdirectory within the *`simulations/`* subdirectory
created for that simulation run with the name
'<assembly-name>'*`.`*'<sim-platform>'*`.`*'<date-time>'.
Thus, running OpenCPI applications that use simulators results
in one or more subdirectories that hold the simulation
results for each simulation run.

The results of an FPGA simulator run for a component unit test
reside in a '<sim-platform>'*`/`* subdirectory of the
component unit test's *`run/`* directory with the name
'<test-case-name>'*`.`*'<unit-test-name>'*`.hdl.simulation`*.

The '<directory>' argument specifies the directory that contains
a particular simulation run. If it is not used, the tool runs
the most recent simulation run in the *`simulations/`* subdirectory.

The chapter "Execution of Simulation Bitstreams and Containers"
in the 'OpenCPI HDL Development Guide' provides more information
about using FPGA simulators to run OpenCPI applications. The chapter
"Unit Testing of Workers" in the 'OpenCPI Component Development Guide'
provides more information about developing component unit tests, as
does link:ocpidev-test.1.html[ocpidev-test(1)].

EXAMPLES
--------
. Inside the project, display the results of running an HDL
assembly named *`myassembly`* on the *`xsim`* FPGA simulator:
+
----------------------------------------------------
ocpiview simulations/myassembly.xsim.20200815143505
----------------------------------------------------
+
. Inside the project, display the results of the most recent
simulation run with verbose command output:
+
-----------
ocpiview -v
-----------
+
. Inside the component unit test's directory in the project,
display the results of running a component unit test
named *`mytest`* on the *`xsim`* FPGA simulator
platform using the default test case:
+
---------------------------------------------------
$ ocpiview run/xsim/case00.00.mytest.hdl.simulation
---------------------------------------------------
