OCPITEST(1)
===========


NAME
----
ocpitest - command-line tool for running tests from the OpenCPI test suite


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpitest`* ['<options>'] ['<test>'...]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`ocpitest(1)`* command-line tool is used to run all or specific tests in the OpenCPI test suite.
The tests in the OpenCPI test suite run automatically during OpenCPI installation to
verify that all parts of OpenCPI are properly installed and function as expected.
Running these tests individually can also be useful for troubleshooting an OpenCPI installation.

The *`ocpitest`* command can be run in three different contexts that correspond to the
modes of operation for OpenCPI on embedded systems:

- On a development system to test that system.

- On an embedded system with network access to a development system.

- On a standalone embedded system without any network access to a development system.

The second and third contexts correspond to the "network" and "standalone" modes of operation for OpenCPI
on embedded systems. See the section "Installation Steps for Systems after their Platforms are Installed" in
the 'OpenCPI Installation Guide' for more details on these modes of operation.

The *`ocpitest`* command runs the tests appropriate for the context in which it runs unless
specific tests are specified on the command line.

To run one or more specific tests, specify the test name(s) listed below as '<test>' argument(s).

Standalone Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*`driver`*::
    Loads the OpenCPI Linux kernel driver. During OpenCPI installation, this test is
    skipped if it is not supported on the target platform, the *`ocpitest`* command is running
    in a docker container, or the test is disabled with the *`--no-kernel`* option.

*`os`*::
    Run the tests in the '<location-of-opencpi>'*/cdk/*'<target-platform-directory>'*/bin/* directory
    that test the OpenCPI framework's operating system abstraction layer.

*`datatype`*::
    Run the datatype/protocol tests.

*`load-plugins`*::
    Load all OpenCPI plugins.

*`container`*::
    Run the set of tests that exercise various features of software containers.

Network Access Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
*`assets`*::
    Run the applications in the built-in *`assets`* project.

Development System Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
*`swig`*::
    Test the python interfaces that correspond to the C++ ACI.
    
*`python`*::
    Run the Python utility tests in the *`tests/pytests/project/`* directory.
    
*`project`*::
    Run the tests in the "test" project ( *`projects/test/`*).
    
*`ocpidev`*::
    Run the *`ocpidev`* tests.

*`core`*::
    Run the unit tests for components in the built-in *`core`* project (*`projects/core/`*).

*`inactive`*::
    Run the application tests in the built-in *`inactive`* project (*`projects/inactive/`*).

OPTIONS
-------
In addition to the options common to all OpenCPI tools (see link:opencpi.1.html[opencpi(1)]),
the following options can be specified:

*`--no-hdl`*::
    Suppress building and testing of HDL assets (HDL platform discovery is not performed).
    
*`--no-kernel`*::
    Suppress running the *`driver`* test when it might otherwise be run.
    This option is specified when *`ocpitest`* is run by *`install-opencpi.sh`*
    and the *`--no-kernel`* option is passed to *`install-opencpi.sh`*.

*`--showtests`*::
    List the tests available to run with *`ocpitest`*.


EXAMPLES
--------
. List the tests that can be run with *`ocpitest`*:
+
---------------------
ocpitest --showtests
---------------------
+
. Run the network mode tests without building and running any HDL assets:
+
------------------------
ocpitest --no-hdl assets
------------------------
+
. Run all tests except for the *`driver`* test:
+
---------------------
ocpitest --no-kernel
---------------------
+
. Run the *`swig`* and *`python`* tests:
+
--------------------
ocpitest swig python
