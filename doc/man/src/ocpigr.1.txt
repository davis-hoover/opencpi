NAME
----
ocpigr - command-line tool for generating GNU Radio Companion block files from OpenCPI artifacts


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpigr`* ['<options>']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`ocpigr(1)`* command-line tool is used to generate
GNU Radio Companion (GRC)-compatible files that correspond
to 'artifacts', the binaries/executables generated from building OpenCPI workers.
The *`ocpigr`* tool searches OpenCPI project libraries for artifacts
and generates GRC "block" files that correspond to the
artifacts it discovers. These block files can then be used
with GNU Radio Companion (GRC), the graphical user interface
for developing GNU Radio applications, providing a way to use
OpenCPI component implementations - the workers - in GNU Radio
applications.

The *`ocpigr`* tool searches the project libraries specified
in the *`OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH`* environment variable; if this variable
is not set, it searches the libraries of projects registered in the
OpenCPI project registry.

For each component specification in a library, it determines
which platforms are implemented by the artifacts it finds,
the authoring model(s) that each platform supports, and
the component-specific and worker-specific properties and ports.
It uses this data to build YAML-formatted,
GRC-structured worker ('<worker-id>'*`.block.yml`*), worker tree (*`ocpi.tree.yml`*),
per-platform domain (*`ocpi_`*'<platform-id>'*`.block.yml`*), and container
(*`ocpi_container.yml`*) block files in the
current directory or the directory specified in
the *`--directory`* (*`-D`*) option.

VERBS
-----
None.

NOUNS
-----
None.

OPTIONS
------
Options are either single letters following one
hyphen or hyphen-separated words or acronyms following two hyphens.
When invoked without options, *`ocpigr`* displays help information.

*`--directory=`*'<output-dir>', *`-D`* '<output-dir>'::
    Specify the directory in which to place the generated GRC block files.
    If this option is not used, *`ocpigr`* places the
    generated block files into the directory in which it runs.

*`--help`*, *`-h`*::
    Display usage information about the tool.

*`--verbose`*, *`-v`*::
    Describe what is happening during command
    execution in more detail.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The following environment variables affect *`ocpigr`* operation:

*`OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH`*::
    A list of directories, separated by colons, to be searched for artifacts.
    When referencing the artifacts exported by a project with sources, be sure
    to reference the project's *`exports/`* subdirectory, not its source location.
    
EXAMPLES
--------
. Generate GRC block files for available artifacts
and place them in the directory named *`mydir`*:
+
------------------------
ocpigr --directory=mydir 
------------------------
+
. Generate GRC block files for available artifacts
into the current directory, displaying
progress information about the operation:
+
-----------------
ocpigr --verbose
