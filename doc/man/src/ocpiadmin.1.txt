OCPIADMIN(1)
===========


NAME
----
ocpiadmin - command-line tool for managing an OpenCPI installation.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ocpiadmin* ['<options>'] '<verb>' '<noun>' ['<name>' ['<argument>'... ]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`ocpiadmin(1)`* command-line tool is used to perform installation
and deployment tasks that are carried out on an OpenCPI installation
after the basic installation procedure is completed to prepare
OpenCPI for use on embedded systems. These tasks include:

- Building platforms and simulators that are intended
as targets for OpenCPI development that have not been
automatically built as part of the basic OpenCPI
installation. Building a platform enables
OpenCPI assets for that platform to be developed in OpenCPI
projects. It also enables the platform to be integrated into
system boot kits - for example, on bootable SD cards - to
be created for embedded systems that use them.

- Creating a bootable media directory tree ('SD card contents')
for OpenCPI required by the software (RCC) and hardware
(HDL/FPGA) platforms that comprise the embedded system.
The bootable media directory tree for a particular
software-hardware platform configuration can
then be written to the manufacturer's SD card
to enable booting the embedded system for OpenCPI.

For more information about these tasks and how they
relate to enabling OpenCPI development on embedded systems,
see The 'OpenCPI Installation Guide'.

The general usage concept for *`ocpiadmin`* is:
perform the '<verb>' operation on the
'<noun>' whose name is '<name>'.


VERBS
-----
The verbs supported by *`ocpiadmin`* are:

*`deploy`*::
    Create a bootable media directory tree for the named
    RCC (software) platform on the named HDL (FPGA)
    platform. The specified platforms must have
    been previously built.

*`install`*::
    Prepare the OpenCPI installation for using the named
    RCC or HDL platform or simulator.

NOUNS
-----
The nouns supported by *`ocpiadmin`* are:

*`platform`*::
    A particular type of processing hardware and/or software that
    can host a container for executing OpenCPI workers. 

OPTIONS
-------
There are currently no options to *`ocpiadmin`* verbs.

OPERATIONS
----------
The command syntax for the *`install platform`* operation is:

*`ocpiadmin install platform`* '<platform>'

where '<platform>' is the name of an RCC platform, HDL platform or HDL simulator
to be built for OpenCPI. The operation downloads
the platform's 'OpenCPI Platform System support Project' (its 'OSP') if necessary and then builds the
built-in projects for the specified platform. If the specified platform is
an HDL platform, the operation also builds a single test artifact/bitstream:
the *`testbias`* assembly in the *`assets`* project. After
the operation is performed, any asset in any project can be
built for the specified platform.

The command syntax for the *`deploy platform`* operation is:

*`ocpiadmin deploy platform`* '<rcc-platform> <hdl-platform>'

where '<rcc-platform>' and '<hdl-platform>' are the names of the
software (RCC) and hardware/FPGA (HDL) platforms for which the bootable
media should be created. The operation creates the directory
*`cdk/`*'<hdl-platform>'*`/sdcard-`*'<rcc-platform>',
whose contents can be copied to an SD card.

Keywords for specifying platform names are given in tables in the
'OpenCPI Installation Guide'.


EXAMPLES
--------
. Build the Ettus USRP E310 (*`e31x`*) HDL platform for OpenCPI:
+
-------------------------------
ocpiadmin install platform e31x
-------------------------------
+
. Build the Analog Devices Pluto Linux 0.31 (*`adi_plutosdr0_31`*)
embedded software (RCC) platform for OpenCPI:
+
-------------------------------------------
ocpiadmin install platform adi_plutosdr0_31
-------------------------------------------
+
. Create a bootable media directory tree
for booting the RCC platform *`xilinx_19_2_aarch32`* on
the HDL platform *`zed`*. This operation creates the
directory *`cdk/zed/sdcard-xilinx_19_2_aarch32/`*,
whose contents can be copied to an SD card:
+
-------------------------------------------------
ocpiadmin deploy platform xilinx_19_2_aarch32 zed
-------------------------------------------------
