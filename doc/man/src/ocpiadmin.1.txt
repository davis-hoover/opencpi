OCPIADMIN(1)
===========


NAME
----
ocpiadmin - command-line tool for managing an OpenCPI installation


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpiadmin`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' '<noun>' ['<name>' ['<argument>'... ]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`ocpiadmin(1)`* command-line tool is used to perform installation
and deployment tasks that are carried out on an OpenCPI installation
after the basic installation procedure is completed to prepare
OpenCPI for use on embedded systems. These tasks include:

- Building platforms and simulators that are intended
as targets for OpenCPI development that have not been
automatically built as part of the basic OpenCPI
installation. Building a platform enables
OpenCPI assets for that platform to be developed in OpenCPI
projects. It also enables the platform to be integrated into
system boot kits - for example, on bootable SD cards - to
be created for embedded systems that use them.

- Creating a bootable media directory tree ('SD card contents')
for OpenCPI required by the software (RCC) and hardware
(HDL/FPGA) platforms that comprise the embedded system.
The bootable media directory tree for a particular
software-hardware platform configuration can
then be written to the manufacturer's SD card
to enable booting the embedded system for OpenCPI.

For more information about these tasks and how they
relate to enabling OpenCPI development on embedded systems,
see the 'OpenCPI Installation Guide'.

The general usage concept for *`ocpiadmin`* is:
perform the '<verb>' operation on the
'<noun>' whose name is '<name>'.


VERBS
-----
The verbs supported by *`ocpiadmin`* are:

*`deploy`*::
    Create a bootable media directory tree for the named
    RCC (software) platform on the named HDL (FPGA)
    platform. The specified platforms must have
    been previously built.

*`install`*::
    Prepare the OpenCPI installation for using the named
    RCC or HDL platform or simulator.

NOUNS
-----
The nouns supported by *`ocpiadmin`* are:

*`platform`*::
    A particular type of processing hardware and/or software that
    can host a container for executing OpenCPI workers.

OPTIONS
-------
The following options can be specified for the *`install`* verb only:

*`--git-revision=`*'<git-rev>', *`-g`* '<git-rev>'::
    Specifies the branch, tag or other valid *`git`* revision to check out after
    downloading/cloning the project specified in the *`--package-id`* (*`-p`*) option (described below).
    This option can be used with the *`--package-id`* option
    to install a different *`git`* revision of a project from the one currently checked out.
    If this option is not used, the *`git`* revision for the specified package-ID defaults
    to the *`git`* revision of the OpenCPI framework repository.

*`--package-id=`*'<package-id>', *`-p`* '<package-id>'::
    Specifies the OpenCPI package-ID of the project that provides the support
    for the platform. This option is only required when support for
    the platform is provided in an 'OSP' ('OpenCPI System support Platform')
    instead of in a built-in OpenCPI project.
    The default format for a package-ID is '<package-prefix>'*.*'<package-name>';
    for example, *`ocpi.osp.e3xx`*, *`ocpi.osp.plutosdr`*. See the chapter on package-IDs in the 'OpenCPI
    Component Development Guide' for details.

*`--url=`*'<url>', *`-u`* '<url>'::
    Specifies the internet URL where the project resides. This option can be
    used with the *`--package-id`* (*`-p`*) option (described above) to specify the location of
    a project that is not hosted on the OpenCPI Gitlab site. If this option
    is not used, the URL defaults to *`https://gitlab.com/opencpi/osps/`*'<package-id>'*`.git`*,
    where '<package-id>' is the one specified in the *`--package-id=`* option.
    For example, if '<package-id>' is *`ocpi.osp.e3xx`*, the URL is
    *`https://gitlab.com/opencpi/osps/ocpi.osps.e3xx.git`*.

*`--minimal=`*::
    Specifies a minimized installation process that does not pre-build HDL workers, not run
    any installation tests.

OPERATIONS
----------
The command syntax for the *`install platform`* operation is:

*`ocpiadmin`* '<options>' *`install platform`* '<platform>'

where '<platform>' is the name of an RCC platform, HDL platform or HDL simulator
to be built for OpenCPI. If necessary, the operation downloads
the platform's OSP into the *`projects/osps/`* directory in the OpenCPI
installation directory and then builds the
built-in projects and the platform's OSP (if any) for the specified platform.
If the specified platform is an HDL platform, the operation also builds
a single test artifact/bitstream: the *`testbias`* assembly in
the *`assets`* project. After the operation is performed, any asset
in any project can be built for the specified platform.

The command syntax for the *`deploy platform`* operation is:

*`ocpiadmin deploy platform`* '<rcc-platform> <hdl-platform>'

where '<rcc-platform>' and '<hdl-platform>' are the names of the
software (RCC) and hardware/FPGA (HDL) platforms for which the bootable
media should be created. The operation creates the directory
*`cdk/`*'<hdl-platform>'*`/sdcard-`*'<rcc-platform>',
whose contents can be copied to an SD card.

Keywords for specifying platform names are given in tables in the
'OpenCPI Installation Guide'.


EXAMPLES
--------
. Build the Xilinx Xsim (*`xsim`*) HDL simulator platform for OpenCPI:
+
-------------------------------
ocpiadmin install platform xsim
-------------------------------
+
. Download and build the Ettus USRP E310 (*`e31x`*) HDL platform for OpenCPI:
+
------------------------------------------------------------
 ocpiadmin --package-id=ocpi.osp.e3xx install platform e31x
------------------------------------------------------------
+
. Download and build the Analog Devices Pluto Linux 0.32 (*`adi_plutosdr0_32`*)
embedded software (RCC) platform for OpenCPI:
+
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ocpiadmin --package-id=ocpi.osp.plutosdr install platform adi_plutosdr0_32
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
. Build the Analog Devices ADALM-PLUTO (*`plutosdr`*) platform
(you have already downloaded the OSP that supports this platform if you performed the previous example):
+
-----------------------------------
ocpiadmin install platform plutosdr
-----------------------------------
+
. Download the third-party OSP that provides the *`myplat`* platform
from the Github site and build the platform:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ocpiadmin --package-id=com.myco.myplat --url=https://github.com/myco/myplat.git install platform myplat
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
. Download and build the latest "development" *`git`* revision of the *`plutosdr`* platform
from a working branch using an earlier version:
+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ocpiadmin --package-id=ocpi.osp.plutosdr --git-revision=develop install platform plutosdr
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
. Create a bootable media directory tree
for booting the RCC platform *`xilinx19_2_aarch32`* on
the HDL platform *`zed`*. This operation creates the
directory *`cdk/zed/sdcard-xilinx19_2_aarch32/`*,
whose contents can be copied to an SD card:
+
------------------------------------------------
ocpiadmin deploy platform xilinx19_2_aarch32 zed
------------------------------------------------
