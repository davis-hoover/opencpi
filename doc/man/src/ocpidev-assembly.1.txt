OCPIDEV-ASSEMBLY(1)
==================


NAME
----
ocpidev-assembly - manage an OpenCPI HDL assembly.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`hdl assembly`* '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`hdl assembly`* noun represents an OpenCPI HDL assembly, which is a
group of pre-connected HDL workers built as an 'artifact' - a binary
executable compiled from the workers - intended
for use as an FPGA-based subset of an OpenCPI application.

An HDL assembly is described by an OpenCPI HDL Assembly Description (OHAD),
which is an XML file that specifies the HDL workers that make up
the HDL assembly and the connections between them. The OHAD defines
the worker instances, any properties and parameter settings, connections
between workers and external ports for any data flowing into or out of
the assembly. For information about the OHAD's XML structure,
see the section "The HDL Assembly XML File" in the 'OpenCPI HDL
Development Guide'

In a project, an HDL assembly resides in its own directory '<name>'
under an *`assemblies/`* subdirectory in the project's *`hdl/`* directory.
An HDL assembly directory contains the assembly's OHAD XML file
(named '<name>'*`.xml`*).
The *`ocpidev create`* operation produces initial versions of these
files that can then be edited as necessary.

When an HDL assembly is built, the result - the executable artifact
file (with the suffix *`.bitz`* or *`.gz`*) - is placed in
an *`artifacts`* directory at the top level of the project.
The *`ocpidev build`* operation also creates additional directories
and files in the HDL assembly's directory, including a container
artifact built for the target platform in a directory
*`container-`*'<platform>'.
The *`ocpidev clean`* operation removes the files created by
the *`ocpidev build`* operation.

For information on how to develop an HDL assembly,
see the chapter "HDL Assemblies for Creating Bitstreams/Executables"
in the 'OpenCPI HDL Development Guide'.

Verbs that can operate on an HDL assembly are:

*`build`*::
    Build the HDL assembly, creating directories and files
    as required.

*`clean`*::
    Remove all the generated and compiled files for all assets
    in the HDL assembly.
    
*`create`*::
    Create the named HDL assembly, creating files and directories as required.
    
*`delete`*::
    Remove all directories and files associated with the named HDL assembly.
    
*`utilization`*::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the HDL assembly.

Note that an asset's name is implied by the directory you're in when
you issue the *`ocpidev`* command. For HDL assemblies, this
means that you can perform operations (verbs) on the HDL assembly
without having to specify its name when you issue the
*`ocpidev`* command from inside the HDL assembly's directory.

The *`ocpidev`* tool can also operate on a plural *`hdl assemblies`* noun.
The syntax is:

*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] [*`build|clean|utilization`*] *`hdl assemblies`*

The verbs that can be performed on the *`hdl assemblies`* noun are:

*`build`*::
    Build all of the HDL assemblies in the project or the *`/hdl`*
    subdirectory of the project, creating directories and files as required.
    
*`clean`*::
    Remove all the generated and compiled files in all HDL assemblies
    in the project or the *`/hdl`* subdirectory of the project.
    
*`utilization`*::
    Display FPGA resource usage information for all built HDL assemblies
    in the project. The general-pupose options and the *`utilization`*
    options can be specified.

OPTIONS
-------
In the descriptions below, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates
that it can be specified more than once on the command line.

Keywords for platforms supported by OpenCPI that can be
specified in the '<platform>' argument to an option
can be found in the tables of supported platforms in the 'OpenCPI User Guide'.

Keywords for architectures supported by OpenCPI that can be specified
in the '<target>' argument to an option include *`isim`*, *`modelsim`*,
*`xsim`*, *`stratix4`*, *`stratix5`*, *`virtex5`*, *`virtex6`*, *`zynq`*,
*`zynq_is`*, *`spartan3adsp`*.

Options That Apply to All Operations (Verbs) on HDL Assemblies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*-d <directory>*::
    Specify the directory in which the command should be run.
    Analogous to the *-C* option in the POSIX *make* command.
    
*-v, --verbose*::
    Describe what is happening in command execution in more detail.

Options When Creating HDL Assemblies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--exclude-platform=`*'<platform>', *`-Q`* '<platform>'+::
    Do not build the HDL assembly for the specified HDL platform.
   
*`--only-platform=`*'<platform>', *-G* '<platform>'+::
    Only build the HDL assembly for the specified HDL platform.
   
*-T* '<target>'+::
    Only build the HDL assembly for the specified HDL architecture.
   
*-Z* '<target>'+::
    Do not build the HDL assembly for the specified HDL architecture.
   
*-k*::
    Keep files and directories created after an HDL assembly creation
    fails. Normally, all such files and directories are removed
    on any failure.

Options When Deleting HDL Assemblies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*-f*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    an HDL assembly. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.

Options When Building HDL Assemblies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--hdl-target=`*'<target>'+::
    Build the HDL assembly/ies for the specified HDL architecture.
    If only HDL targets
    are specified (and no HDL platforms), containers are not built.

*`--hdl-platform=`*'<hdl-platform>'+::
    Build the HDL assembly/ies for the specified HDL platform.

Options When Using Utilization on HDL Assemblies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--format=`*{*`table`*|*`latex`*}::
    Specify the format in which to output the FPGA resource usage information.
    Specifying *`table`* sends the information to stdout in tabular format.
    Specifying *`latex`* bypasses *`stdout`* and writes all output to
    *`utilization.inc`* files in the directories for the assets on
    which it operates.
    
*`--hdl-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the built HDL assemblies
    on the specified HDL platform.

*`--hdl-library=`*'<library>'::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the built
    HDL assemblies in the specified HDL primitive library.

*`--library=`*'<library>', *`-l`* '<library>'::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the built
    HDL assemblies in the specified component library.

*`-P`* '<hdl-platform>'::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by the built
    HDL assemblies on the specified HDL platform.
