OCPIDEV-SLOT(1)
==============


NAME
----
ocpidev-slot - manage an OpenCPI HDL slot.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`hdl slot`* '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`hdl slot`* noun represents an OpenCPI HDL slot,
which defines an integral part of an HDL platform
that enables an 'HDL card' to be plugged in to make its
attached devices accessible to the platform. An HDL
platform has defined slot types; HDL cards
that are designed for the same slot type can be plugged in
to the defined slots on the platform.

An HDL slot is described by an OpenCPI HDL slot type definition,
which is an XML file that defines the signal connections to
the pins of the connectors associated with the slot type and
provides an (optional) name for the slot type that can
be used in HDL Platform Descriptions (OHPDs) and HDL card
definitions. OpenCPI provides HDL slot definitions for a number of
standard slot types, like the FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card), which
is defined by the by the VITA standards organization as VITA-57.1.
Defining a new slot type for use in OpenCPI consists of defining
an HDL slot type definition for it; writing HDL code to support
an HDL slot is not normally necessary. For more information
about the XML structure of an HDL slot type definition
and how it relates to HDL platforms, devices and cards, see the
section "Slots - How Cards Plug into Platforms" in the
'OpenCPI Platform Development Guide'.

In a project, an HDL slot resides in the *`specs/`* subdirectory of
the *`hdl/cards/`* subdirectory and is named '<name>'*`.xml`*, where '<name>'
must be a name that can be used in programming languages (uses underscores
rather than hyphens) but is otherwise case insensitive. The HDL slot
name should normally be the exact name used in the standard document
that defines the slot type.

Verbs that can operate on an HDL slot are:

*`create`*::
    Create the named HDL slot according to the specified options,
    creating directories and files as required.

*`delete`*::
    Remove all files associated with the named HDL slot.

OPTIONS
-------
In the descriptions below, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates
that it can be specified more than once on the command line.

Options That Apply to All Operations (Verbs) on Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-d`* '<directory>'::
    Specify the directory in which the command should be run.
    Analogous to the *-C* option in the POSIX *make* command.

*-v, --verbose*::
    Describe what is happening in command execution in more detail.
    
Options When Creating HDL Slots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*-k*::
    Keep files and directories created after an HDL slot creation
    fails. Normally, all such files and directories are removed
    on any failure.
  
Options When Deleting HDL Slots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-f`*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    a protocol. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.
    
EXAMPLES
--------
. Inside the project, create an HDL slot with the name *`myslot`*.
The HDL slot definition named *`myslot.xml`* will be placed
in the subdirectory *`hdl/cards/specs/`*:
+
------------------------------
ocpidev create hdl card myslot
------------------------------
+
. Inside the project, delete an HDL slot definition named *`myslot.xml`* from
a project's *`hdl/cards/specs/`* subdirectory:
+
------------------------------
ocpidev delete hdl card myslot
------------------------------
