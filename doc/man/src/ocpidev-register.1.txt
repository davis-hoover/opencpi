OCPIDEV-REGISTER(1)
==================


NAME
----
ocpidev-register - add a project to a project registry.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ocpidev* ['<options>'] *register project*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *register* verb adds the current project to its registry.
If the project has no associated registry, the default one is used and
becomes persistently associated with the project. The default registry
is the one in the OpenCPI installation unless overridden by the
*`OCPI_PROJECT_REGISTRY_DIR`* environment variable.  Registering a
project makes its exports visible and usable to other projects
using the same registry.

The *register* verb creates exports for the currently
available and built assets in the project. If the project
is already registered, the exports are still recreated.

Asset types to be specified in the '<noun>' argument are:

*project*::
    Register the project in a registry.

OPTIONS
-------
The general purpose options (*`-v`* and *`-d`* '<directory>') can be used.
In particular, the *`-d`* '<directory>' option can be used to specify
the pathname of the project being registered.
There are no verb-specific options.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Register the current project to its registry (or the default
if it doesn't have one yet):
