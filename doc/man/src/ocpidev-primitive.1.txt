OCPIDEV-PRIMITIVE(1)
====================


NAME
----
ocpidev-primitive - manage an OpenCPI HDL primitive.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`hdl primitive`* {*`core`*|*`library`*} '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`hdl primitive`* noun represents an OpenCPI primitive, which is an HDL asset
at a level that is lower than HDL workers and that can be used as building
blocks for workers or other primitives. HDL primitives are useful when there is lower-level code
that is reused or shared in different HDL workers or when workers import
non-OpenCPI code modules that should be left untouched.

An HDL primitive is either:

- An *`HDL primitive library`*, which is a collection of HDL 
primitive modules compiled from source code into a library
from which individual modules can be used as needed by HDL workers or other primitives or cores.

- An *`HDL primitive core`*, which is a single primitive module that can be
built and/or synthesized from source code, imported from a third party
presynthesized and possibly encrypted, or generated by vendor-specific
FPGA synthesis tools like Xilinx CoreGen and Altera MegaWizard.

In a project, an HDL primitive resides in its own directory '<name>' in the
*`hdl/primitives/`* subdirectory.
An HDL primitive cannot have the same name as a worker.
The directory contains the HDL primitive's XML file, '<name>'*`.xml`*, and
its source code (Verilog or VHDL, with possible pre-built files
for HDL primitive cores). The *`ocpidev create`* operation for an HDL primitive
creates an initial version of the '<name>'*`.xml`* file
and, for primitive libraries, an initial '<name>'*`_pkg.vhd`* file.
These files can then be edited as necessary for the HDL primitive.
For details on how to develop an HDL primitive, see the chapter
"HDL Primitives" in the 'OpenCPI HDL Development Guide'.

A skeleton OpenCPI HDL primitive library or core asset document
is also created along with the initial primitive XML file and
(for a primitive library) VHDL file to allow for HDL primitive
documentation development to occur during the overall HDL primitive
development process. Unless suppressed by an option, compiling
the HDL primitive or the asset that contains it
also generates viewable HTML output of its asset document. The chapter
"Documenting OpenCPI Assets" in the 'OpenCPI Documentation Writer Guide'
provides more information about this feature and how to write a
HDL primitive asset document.

Verbs that can operate on an HDL primitive are:

*`build`*::
    Compile the HDL primitive source code and its asset document, creating
    files and directories as required. Use the *`--doc-only`* and *`--no-doc`*
    options to control the asset document building function.
    
*`clean`*::
    Remove all generated and compiled files for the HDL primitive.
    Use the *`--doc-only`* and *`--no-doc`* options
    to control the asset document cleaning function.

*`create`*::
    Create the named HDL primitive, creating files and directories as required.

*`delete`*::
    Remove all directories and files associated with the named HDL primitive.
    
Note that an asset's name is implied by the directory you're in when
you issue the *`ocpidev`* command. For an HDL primitive, this means that you can
perform operations (verbs) on the HDL primitive without having to specify its
name when you issue the *`ocpidev`* command from inside the HDL primitive directory.

The *`ocpidev`* tool can also operate on a plural *`primitives`* noun.
The syntax is:

*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] [*`build`*|*`clean`*] *`primitives`*

where the *`build`* and *`clean`* operations and any specified options
are applied to all HDL primitives in a project.

OPTIONS
-------
In addition to the options common to all OpenCPI tools
(see link:opencpi.1.html[opencpi(1)]),
the options described below can be specified for operations on HDL primitives.
In the following descriptions, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates
that it can be specified more than once on the command line.

Keywords for platforms supported by OpenCPI that can be
specified in the '<platform>' argument to an option
can be found in the tables of supported platforms in the 'OpenCPI User Guide'.

Keywords for architectures supported by OpenCPI that can be specified
in the '<target>' argument to an option include *`isim`*, *`modelsim`*,
*`xsim`*, *`zynq`*, *`zynq_ultra`*, *`zynq_ise`*, *`spartan3adsp`*.

Options When Creating HDL Primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-G`* '<platform>', *`--only-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Only build the HDL primitive for the specified HDL platform.

*`-Q`* '<platform>', *`--exclude-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Do not build the HDL primitive for the specified HDL platform.

*`-T`* '<target>', *`--only-target=`*'<target>'+::
    Only build the HDL primitive for the specified HDL architecture.
   
*`-Z`* '<target>', *`--exclude-target=`*'<target>'+::
    Do not build the HDL primitive for the specified HDL architecture.

*`-k`*, *`--keep`*::
    Keep files and directories created after an HDL primitive creation
    fails. Normally, all such files and directories are removed
    on any failure.

Options When Creating HDL Primitive Cores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-B`* '<file>', *`--prebuilt=`*'<file>'::
    Specify the name of a prebuilt core file created by a
    vendor-specific core generator tool; for example,
    an *`.edf`* file from Xilinx Vivado, an *`.ngc`* file
    from Coregen or a *`.qxp`* file from Quartus.

*`-M`* '<module>', *`--module=`*'<module>'::
    Specify the name of the top module at the core. If this option is
    not specified, the default module name used is the name of the core
    specified in the '<name>' argument to the *`create`* operation.

Options When Creating HDL Primitive Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-H`*, *`--no-depend`*::
    Specify that the HDL primitive library being created does not depend on any
    other HDL primitive libraries. By default, HDL primitive libraries
    are assumed to depend on the certain primitive libraries in
    *`$OCPI_ROOT_DIR/projects/core/hdl/primitives`*
    (currently *`bsv`*, *`cdc`*, *`fixed_float`*, and *`ocpi`*).

*`-J`*, *`--no-elaborate`*::
    Specify that the HDL primitive library being created should
    not be elaborated when built. Using this option results
    in a slight time savings at the cost of catching elaboration
    errors in the build process.

Options When Deleting HDL Primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-f`*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    an HDL primitive. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.

Options When Building and Cleaning HDL Primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--doc-only`*::
   Only operate on the HDL primitive's asset document and not on the other
   primitive asset files.
   
*`--no-doc`*::
   Only operate on the HDL primitive's asset files and not on the primitive's
   asset document.

Options When Building HDL Primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--hdl-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Build the HDL primitive for the specified platform.

*`--hdl-target=`*'<target>'+::
    Build the HDL primitive for the specified HDL architecture.
    If HDL targets are specified and no HDL platforms are specified,
    containers are not built for HDL assemblies or component unit test suites.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Inside the project or the project's *`hdl/primitives/`* directory,
create an HDL primitive core named *`myprimcore`* where the top module
of the core will be *`mytopmod`*:
+
--------------------------------------------------------
ocpidev -M mytopmod create hdl primitive core myprimcore
--------------------------------------------------------
+
. Inside the project or the project's *`hdl/primitives/`* directory,
create an HDL primitive library named *`myprimlib`*
and indicate that it does not depend on any other primitive
libraries:
+
-------------------------------------------------
ocpidev -H create hdl primitive library myprimlib
-------------------------------------------------
+
. In the project that contains the HDL primitive, compile
the source code for the HDL primitive core named *`myprimcore`*
for the Zynq architecture but do not build its asset document:
+
---------------------------------------------------------------------
ocpidev build hdl primitive core myprimcore --hdl-target=zynq --no-doc
---------------------------------------------------------------------
+
. Inside the project, remove the generated HTML output of the HDL primitive
asset documents for all HDL primitives in the project:
+
--------------------------------------
ocpidev clean hdl primitives --doc-only
--------------------------------------
