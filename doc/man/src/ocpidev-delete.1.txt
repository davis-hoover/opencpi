=================


NAME
----
ocpidev-delete - delete OpenCPI assets


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ocpidev* ['<options>'] *delete* '<noun>' '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`delete`* verb deletes OpenCPI assets from a
project specified by the '<noun>' argument that follows the verb.

Asset types to be specified in the '<noun>' argument are:

*application*::
    Delete an application.

*hdl*::
    A prefix to indicate an HDL asset in the *hdl* subdirectory of a project.
    Possible HDL assets are:
    
        *assembly*;;
	Delete an HDL assembly.
	
	*card*;;
	Delete an HDL card definition.
	
	*device*;;
	Create/delete an HDL device worker, possibly in a
	specified platform.
	
	*platform*;;
	Delete an HDL platform.
	
	*primitive*;;
	Delete an HDL primitive. Possible primitive types are:
		    
	    *core*:::
	    A single primitive module, perhaps presynthesized
	    (that is, from coregen or megawizard).
	    
	    *library*:::
	    A set of HDL primitive modules to use in workers as a library.

	*`slot`*;;
	Delete an HDL slot definition.    

*library*::
    Delete a component library.
    
*project*::
    Delete a project which holds and organizes OpenCPI assets.

*protocol*::
    Delete a protocol in a library or project.

*registry*::
    Delete a registry that enables projects to depend on each other.

*spec*::
    Delete a component specification in a library or project.

*test*::
    Delete a component unit test in a library.

*worker*::
    Delete a worker in a library.

All HDL assets should avoid having names that are Verilog or VHDL-
reserved identifiers, such as `reg`, etc.

OPTIONS
-------
The options for *delete* are usually specific to the asset type
that is being deleted. When deleting an asset, *ocpidev* will
ask for confirmation. You can override this with the *-f* option
to force deletion without confirmation.

In the option descriptions below, a plus sign (+) indicates that
the option can be specified more than once on the command line.

Option When Deleting Any Asset Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*-f*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    an asset. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.

Option When Deleting Specs or Protocols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*-p*::
   Delete the spec or protocol from the *specs*
   directory of the project, not from a library's
   *specs* directory.

Options When Deleting Specs, Protocols, Workers or HDL Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*--hdl-library=*'<hdl-library>'::
   Delete the asset from the specified library under the
   *hdl* directory of the project. Valid values for
   '<hdl-library>' are one of *devices*, *cards* or *adapters*.

*-l* '<library>'::
   Delete the asset from the specified library.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Delete the project *my-project*:
+
-------------------------------
ocpidev delete project my-project
--------------------------------
+
. Delete the worker named *myworker.hdl* from the library named *my-complib*:

-------------------------------
ocpidev delete -l my-complib worker myworker.hdl
