OCPIDEV-WORKER(1)
================


NAME
----
ocpidev-worker - manage an OpenCPI worker.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`worker`* '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`worker`* noun represents an OpenCPI worker, which is a specific
implementation of a component with source code written according
to an OpenCPI 'authoring model'. An authoring model represents
a way to implement a component in a specific language - for example,
C++ or VHDL - using a specific OpenCPI API between the component
and its execution environment. 

A worker is described by an OpenCPI Worker Description (OWD), which
is an XML file that specifies the component that the worker implements,
the language used for its source code, and any additional property
and port information that fine-tunes the component specification (OCS)
for the worker.

In a project, a worker generally resides in its own directory
within a component library. However, some authoring models allow
multiple workers to reside in one worker directory.

The workers that implement a component usually reside in the same library
as the component, although command options allow them to be created
in different libraries or even different projects.

Several types of worker exist:

- An 'RCC worker', which implements the Resource-Constrained C/C++ (RCC) authoring model.
The 'OpenCPI RCC Development Guide' provides details on how to develop an RCC worker.

- An 'HDL worker', which implements the Hardware Definition Language (HDL) model.
The 'OpenCPI HDL Development Guide' provides details on how to develop an HDL worker.

- An 'application worker', which can be an RCC or HDL worker and is a portable,
hardware-independent implementation of a component spec. See the respective
authoring model guides ('OpenCPI RCC Development Guide' and 'OpenCPI HDL Development Guide')
for details on how to develop an application worker.

- An 'HDL device worker', which is a special type of HDL application worker that supports
external devices attached to an FPGA. The 'OpenCPI Platform Development Guide'
provides details on how to develop an HDL device worker.

- An 'HDL adapter worker', which is a special type of HDL application worker that connects workers
with incompatible ports (for example, incompatible protocols). The 'OpenCPI HDL
Development Guide' provide information about developing HDL adapter workers.

- An 'HDL platform worker', which is a special type of HDL device worker that provides
the necessary platform-wide functions for the HDL platform. The 'OpenCPI Platform
Development Guide' provides details on how to develop an HDL platform worker.

Verbs that can operate on a worker are:

*`build`*::
    Compile the worker source code, creating files and directories
    as required. A single worker implementation generally exists
    in its own directory and when compiled, results in a single
    'artifact' (a binary executable compiled from the worker),
    although some authoring models (for example, RCC) allow
    multiple workers to be built as a single artifact.
    
*`clean`*::
    Remove all generated and compiled files for the worker.

*`create`*::
    Create the named worker, creating files and directories as required.
    The worker is created in a directory '<name>'*`.`*'<authoring-model-suffix>'
    under the current working directory where *`ocpidev`* 
    is executed. The general-purpose option *`-d`* '<directory>'
    can be used to create the worker under a different directory.
    Note that multiple workers that implement the same component must
    have different names and at least one of the names must be different
    from the name implied by the component specification.

*`delete`*::
    Remove all directories and files associated with the named worker.
    
*`show`*::
    Display information about the worker.

*`utilization`*::
    Display information about FPGA resource use by an HDL worker.

Within the worker's directory are the worker's "make" file (named Makefile),
its OWD (named '<name>'*`.xml`*) and its primary source code file (named
'<name>'*`.`*'<auth-model-language-suffix>', for example, *`.c`*, *`.cc`*
or *`vhd`*). The *`ocpidev create`* operation produces initial versions
of these files that can then be edited as necessary to produce the worker
implementation.

The *`ocpidev build`* operation creates additional files in a worker's directory,
such as architecture-independent source code and XML files, in a directory
named *`gen`* and architecture-specific object and binary files for
the compilation target being built, in a directory named
*`target-`*'<platform>'; for example, *`target-centos7`* or *`target-xsim`*.
These are the files that the *`ocpidev clean`* operation removes.

For general information on how to develop a worker, see the chapters
"Introduction to Worker Development" and "Developing Workers"
in the 'OpenCPI Component Development Guide'. For detailed information
on the OpenCPI authoring models and how to use them to develop worker
source code, see the 'OpenCPI RCC Development Guide', the
'OpenCPI HDL Development Guide', and the 'OpenCPI OpenCL
Development Guide' (OpenCL is currently an experimental
authoring model).

Note that an asset's name is implied by the directory you're in when
you issue the *`ocpidev`* command. For workers, this means that you can
perform operations (verbs) on the worker without having to specify its
name when you issue the *`ocpidev`* command from inside the worker directory.

The *`ocpidev`* tool can also operate on a plural *`workers`* noun.
The syntax is:

*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] [*`show`*|*`utilization`*] *`workers`*

The verbs that can be performed on the *`workers`* noun are:

*`show`*::
    Display information about all workers in any registered
    projects. The general-purpose options and the *`show`*
    formatting options can be specified.

*`utilization`*::
    Display information about FPGA resource use for all built HDL workers
    in a project or library. The general-purpose options
    and the *`utilization`* options can be specified.

OPTIONS
-------
In the descriptions below, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates
that it can be specified more than once on the command line.

Keywords for platforms supported by OpenCPI that can be
specified in the '<platform>' argument to an option
can be found in the tables of supported platforms in the 'OpenCPI User Guide'.

Keywords for architectures supported by OpenCPI that can be specified
in the '<target>' argument to an option include *`isim`*, *`modelsim`*,
*`xsim`*, *`stratix4`*, *`stratix5`*, *`virtex5`*, *`virtex6`*, *`zynq`*,
*`zynq_is`*, *`spartan3adsp`*.

Options That Apply to All Operations (Verbs) on Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*`--hdl-library=`*'<hdl-library>'::
    Specify the HDL library in which to operate on the worker.
    HDL libraries exist underneath the *`hdl/`* directory
    located at the top level of a project.

*`--library=`*'<component-library>', *`-l`* '<component-library>'::
    Specify the component library in which to operate on the worker.
    When a project contains multiple component libraries, this option
    can be used to specify one of them. Multiple component
    libraries are located underneath the *`components`* directory
    at the top level of a project.

*`-d`* '<directory>'::
    Specify the directory in which the command should be run.
    Analogous to the *-C* option in the POSIX *make* command.
    
*`-v`*, *`--verbose`*::
    Describe what is happening in command execution in more detail.

Options When Creating Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--exclude-platform=`*'<platform>', *`-Q`* '<platform>'+::
    Do not build the worker for the specified platform. See
    also the description of the *`ExcludePlatforms=`* OWD attribute
    in the 'OpenCPI Component Development Guide'.

*`--only-platform=`*'<platform>', *`-G`* '<platform>'+::

    Specify a directory to search for include files (C, C++,
    Verilog).

*`-L`* '<language>'::
    Specify the source language for the worker being
    created. By default, the worker is created for
    the default language for the authoring model, which
    must be C or C++ for RCC workers and VHDL for HDL workers.

*`-O`* '<file>'+::
    Specify a source code file to compile when building the
    worker that is not included by default; that is, in
    addition to the '<name>'*`.`*'<authoring-language-suffix>' file.

*`-P`* '<hdl-platform>'::
    Specify that the worker should be created in the *`devices`*
    library for the specified HDL platform in the project. This
    option is intended for use when creating a platform-specific
    device worker or device proxy. A *`devices`* library is located
    in '<project>'*`/hdl/platforms/`*'<hdl-platform>'*`/devices/`*.
    For example, *`hdl/platforms/matchstiq_z1/devices`*.

*`-S`* '<component-spec>'::
    Specify the component spec (OCS) that the worker implements.
    The default is '<name>'*`-spec`* or '<name>'*`_spec`*
    depending on what *`ocpidev`* finds in the *`specs`* directory
    of the library or project (or libraries specified with the *`-y`*
    option or other projects specified by the *`-D`* option when the
    project that contains the worker was created).
   
*`-T`* '<target>'+::
    Only build the worker for the specified architecture. See also the
    description of the *`OnlyTargets`* OWD attribute in the 'OpenCPI
    Component Development Guide'.

*`-Y`* '<primitive-library>'+::
    Specify a primitive library on which the worker
    depends.
   
*`-Z`* '<target>'+::
    Do not build the worker for the specified architecture. See also
    the description of the *`ExcludeTargets`* OWD attribute in
    the 'OpenCPI Component Development Guide'.

*`-k`*::
    Keep files and directories created after a worker creation
    fails. Normally, all such files and directories are removed
    on any failure.

*`-y`* '<component-library>'+::
   Specify a component library to search for workers, devices
   and/or specs that this worker references.

Options When Creating RCC Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-R`* '<prereq-library>'+::
    Specify a library on which the worker depends and
    to which it should be statically linked.

*`-W`* '<worker>'+::
    Specify one of multiple workers implemented in this RCC
    worker's directory when a single RCC worker directory
    is creating a multi-worker artifact. This option is
    supported but is rarely required or used.

*`-V`* '<worker>'::
    Specify a slave worker for which the worker being
    created is a proxy.

*`-r`* '<prereq-library>'+::
    Specify a library on which the worker depends and
    to which it should be dynamically linked.

Options When Creating HDL Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-C`* '<core>'+::
    Specify an HDL primitive core on which the worker
    depends and with which it should be built.

Options When Deleting Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-f`*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    a worker. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.

Options When Building RCC Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--hdl-rcc-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Build RCC/ACI assets for the RCC platforms associated with the
    specified HDL platform. If this option is not used (and *`--rcc-platform`*
    '<platform>' is also not used), the current development software
    platform is used as the single RCC platform used for building.

*`--rcc-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Build RCC/ACI assets for the specified RCC platform. If this
    option is not used (and *`--hdl-rcc-platform`* '<platform>'
    is also not used), the current development software platform
    is used as the single RCC platform used for building.

Options When Showing Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--global-scope`*::
    Show workers from all registered projects and the
    current project if applicable.
    This is the default scope used if *`-local-scope`* is not used.
    
*`--json`*::
    Format the output in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format
    for integration with other software.

*`--local-scope`*::
    Only show workers in the local project.

*`--simple`*::
    Format the output as simply as possible.
  
*`--table`*::
    Display the output in an easy-to-read table.
    This is the default display format
    used if *`--simple`* or *`--json`* are not used.

*`-P`* '<hdl-platform-directory>'::
    Specify the HDL platform subdirectory in which to operate.

Options When Using Utilization on HDL Workers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`--format=`*{*`table`*|*`latex`*}::
    Specify the format in which to output the FPGA resource usage information.
    Specifying *`table`* sends the information to *`stdout`* in tabular format.
    Specifying *`latex`* bypasses *`stdout`* and writes all output to
    *`utilization.inc`* files in the directories for the assets on
    which it operates.
    
*`--hdl-platform=`*'<platform>'+::
    Specify the buildable HDL platform for which to
    display FPGA resource usage information for the worker(s).
    
*`--hdl-target=`*'<target>'+::
    Specify the buildable HDL architecture for which to
    display FPGA resource usage information for the worker(s).
    
*`-P`* '<hdl-platform-directory>'::
    Specify the HDL platform subdirectory in which
    to operate on the worker(s).
