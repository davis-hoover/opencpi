OCPIDEV-CARD(1)
==============


NAME
----
ocpidev-card - manage an OpenCPI HDL card.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpidev`* ['<options>'] '<verb>' *`hdl card`* '<name>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`hdl card`* noun represents an OpenCPI HDL card, 
which defines a hardware component that contains devices
and plugs into a 'slot' on an HDL platform. Devices are
either directly attached to the pins on an HDL platform
or attached to cards that plug into compatible slots on the platform.
Devices on a card are considered to be part of the card, which can
be plugged into a certain type of slot on any platform, rather than
part of the platform itself.

An HDL card is described by an HDL card definition, which is an
XML file that describes the slot type of the card, the HDL devices
(controlled by HDL device workers) that are present on the card,
and how they are wired to the slot. There is no HDL code associated
with an HDL card. For more information about the HDL card
definition's XML structure and how it relates to HDL platforms,
slots and HDL device workers, see the 'OpenCPI Platform Development Guide'.

In a project, an HDL card is named '<name>'*`.xml`* and resides
in one of the following locations depending on its intended use:

- In the subdirectory *`hdl/cards/specs/`* when the HDL
card is platform-independent

- In the subdirectory *`hdl/platforms/`*'<platform>'*`/devices/specs/`* when
the HDL card is platform-specific

An OpenCPI HDL card asset document can also be created for
an HDL card to facilitate documenting the HDL card during
the overall development process.
In a project, an HDL card asset document resides in
the same directory and has the same name as the HDL card's definition
but with the suffix *`.rst`* instead of *`.xml`*. Unless suppressed
by options, building asset that contains the HDL card (e.g., project,
library) builds viewable HTML output of HDL card asset document,
and cleaning the asset containing the HDL card removes the generated HTML.
The section "Documenting OpenCPI Assets" in the
'OpenCPI Documentation Writer Guide' provides more information about
this feature and describes how to create an OpenCPI HDL card asset document.

Verbs that can operate on an HDL card are:

*`create`*::
    Create the named HDL card according to the specified options,
    creating directories and files as required.

*`delete`*::
    Remove all files associated with the named HDL card.

The *`create`* operation creates an initial HDL card definition
XML file that can be edited as necessary to define the card.


OPTIONS
-------
In addition to the options common to all OpenCPI tools
(see link:opencpi.1.html[opencpi(1)]), the options described
below can be specified for operations on HDL cards.
In the following descriptions, a plus sign (+) after the option indicates
that it can be specified more than once on the command line.
 
Options When Creating HDL Cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-P`* '<hdl-platform>', *`--platform=`*'<hdl-platform>'::
    Specify that the HDL card being created is a platform-specific
    HDL card to be created in the *`devices/specs/`*
    subdirectory in the specified HDL platform in the project.

*`-k`*, *`--keep`*::
    Keep files and directories created after an HDL card creation
    fails. Normally, all such files and directories are removed
    on any failure.
  
Options When Deleting HDL Cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*`-f`*::
    Force deletion: do not ask for confirmation when deleting
    an HDL card. Normally, you are asked to confirm a deletion.
    
EXAMPLES
--------
. At the top level of the project, create an HDL card
with the name *`mycard`*. The HDL card definition
named *`mycard.xml`* will be placed
in the subdirectory *`hdl/cards/specs/`*:
+
------------------------------
ocpidev create hdl card mycard
------------------------------
. At the top level of the project, create an HDL card
with the name *`mycard`* for the platform *`myplatform`*.
The HDL card definition
named *`mycard.xml`* will be placed
in the subdirectory *`hdl/platforms/myplatform/devices/specs/`*:
+
--------------------------------------------
ocpidev create hdl card mycard -P myplatform
--------------------------------------------
+
. Inside the project, delete an HDL card definition named *`mycard.xml`* from
a project's *`hdl/cards/specs/`* subdirectory:
+
------------------------------
ocpidev delete hdl card mycard
