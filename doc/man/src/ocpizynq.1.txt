OCPIZYNQ(1)
===========


NAME
----
ocpizynq - command-line tool for displaying configuration information for Zynq architecture platforms


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`ocpizynq`* ['<options>'] '<argument>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`ocpizynq(1)`* command-line tool is used to obtain hardware configuration
information about an OpenCPI-supported Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip (SoC) platform
and can be used during development and debugging to determine exactly how the
SoC is configured (usually by the bootstrap process outside of OpenCPI).
The tool operates on OpenCPI HDL platforms that use the Xilinx Zynq-7000 series
SoCs, such as the *`zed`*, *`e31x`* and *`plutosdr`* platforms and on HDL platforms that use
the Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ chip architecture, like the *`zcu104`* platform.

Specify one of the following keywords as an argument:

*`axi_hp`*::
    Display how the platform's AXI HP interfaces are configured.

*`devcfg`*::
    Display how the platform's devices are configured. This operation is not currently
    implemented for Zynq Ultrascale+ platforms.

*`clocks`*::
    Display how the platform's clocks are configured.  This operation is not currently
    implemented for Zynq Ultrascale+ platforms.

*`spi`*::
    Display how the platform's SPI interfaces are configured.


OPTIONS
-------
*`--psclk=`*'<frequency>', *`-p`* '<frequency>'::
    Specify the external clock rate in MHz into the Zynq platform's PS_CLK clock.
    The external clock rate is board-dependent and is usually 33.3333e6. Use this option
    to specify the clock rate that the Zynq SoC is receiving from its PS_CLK pin.


EXAMPLES
--------
. Display the configuration of a Zynq 7000 series platform's clocks,
specifying an external clock rate of 34.368 MHz:
