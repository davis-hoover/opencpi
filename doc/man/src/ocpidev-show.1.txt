OCPIDEV-SHOW(1)
================


NAME
----
ocpidev-show - displays information about OpenCPI assets.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ocpidev*  *show* ['<options>'] '<noun>'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`show`* verb is slightly different from other verbs since the command
currently is not associated with a project, but with the operating
environment by default.  There are two scoping options to associate
with the command. By default, the *`--global-scope`* option is set and
it will look in all registered projects (and the current project
if applicable). The registry used is the one in the OpenCPI
installation unless overridden using the *`OCPI_PROJECT_REGISTRY_DIR`*
environment variable.  Use the *`--local-scope`* option to run the
command in just the current project.

Asset types to be specified in the '<noun>' argument are:

*component*::
    Display information on the specified component.
    
*components*::
    Display all components in registered projects.

*libraries*::
    Display information on all the libraries in the current scope.

*platforms*::
    Display all platforms that assets can be built for.

*project*::
    Display information about a project.

*projects*::
    Display all registered projects.

*registry*::
    Display information on the registry.

*targets*::
    Display all targets that assets can be built for.

*tests*::
    Display information on the unit tests in the current
    scope.

*worker*::
    Display information on the specified worker.

*workers*::
    Display all workers in registered projects.

Use the keywords *`rcc`* and *`hdl`* to scope what is displayed
for the *platforms* and *targets* nouns. For example, the command:

--------------------------
ocpidev show hdl platforms
--------------------------

only shows the available HDL platforms.

For HDL platforms shown in the default display format
(see the *`--table`* option below), an asterisk after the platform
name indicates that the platform is registered but has not yet
been built. Note that assemblies and tests cannot be built until
the platform is built.

OPTIONS
-------
In the option descriptions below, a plus sign (+) indicates that
the option can be specified more than once on the command line.

*`--simple`*::
    Format the output as simply as possible.
    
*`--json`*::
    Format the output in JSON format for integration with
    other software.

*`--global-scope`*::
   Show assets from all registered projects and the current project
   if applicable. This is the default scope used if *`-local-scope`*
   is not used.

*--hdl-library=*'<hdl-library>'::
    Specify the HDL library in which this operation
    will be performed.

*--library=*'<library>', *-l* '<library>'::
    Specify the component library in which this operation
    will be performed.

*--local-scope*::
   Only show assets in the local project.

*`--table`*::
    Display the output in an easy-to-read table.
    This is the default display format
    used if *`--simple`* or *`--json`* are not used.
    
*--very-verbose*::
    Be very verbose with output.
    
*--very-very-verbose*::
    Be very, very verbose with output.

*`-P`* '<hdl-platform-directory>'::
    Specify the HDL platform subdirectory in which to operate.
