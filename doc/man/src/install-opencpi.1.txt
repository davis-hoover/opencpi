INSTALL-OPENCPI(1)
================


NAME
----
install-opencpi - command-line tool for installing the OpenCPI framework


SYNOPSIS
--------
*`./scripts/install-opencpi.sh`* ['<options>']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *`install-opencpi`* tool builds/installs the OpenCPI framework on the local
RCC development platform and runs a series of tests to verify the installation.
The tool is intended to be run from the top level (root directory) of the OpenCPI
source tree, and will emit an error message if run from any other directory.
Upon successful completion, the OpenCPI framework is ready for use in developing
and/or running various OpenCPI components and applications.

OPTIONS
-------
*`--minimal`*::
    Performs a standard installation except the tests are not run. 
    Suppressing the generation and running of tests saves time in cases where framework
    testing is obviously unnecessary, e.g., reinstalling the same version of the framework on a host.

*`--no-kernel`*::
    Prevents building of the OpenCPI Linux kernel driver module. See the link:ocpidriver.1.html[ocpidriver(1)]
    man page and the 'OpenCPI User Guide' for details on when this driver module is required.

EXAMPLES
--------
. Install OpenCPI from the root directory of the OpenCPI source tree.
+
----------
./scripts/install-opencpi.sh
----------
. Install OpenCPI without running the installation tests.
+
----------
./scripts/install-opencpi.sh --minimal
----------
. Install OpenCPI without running the installation tests and without building the OpenCPI Linux kernel driver module.
+
----------
./scripts/install-opencpi.sh --minimal --no-kernel
