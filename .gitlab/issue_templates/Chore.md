### Task
(More or less a catch-all if one of the other issue templates don't fit.
Usually a chore is something that is not fixing a bug or implementing a
feature.)

### Acceptance criteria
(Basically a "definition of done" with supporting evidence (job log excerpts,
screenshots, etc.) as appropriate.  Some people prefer to use checkboxes:
- [ ] first objective
- [ ] second objective
- [ ] (etc.)
and provide evidence in the issue comments instead of in this section.)
