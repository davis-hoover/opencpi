### Summary
(Describe what the problem is.  A problem is similar to a bug, but not as well
defined, and is usually external to OpenCPI.)

### Context
(How does this problem affect you?  What were you trying to accomplish?)

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots
(Paste any relevant logs - please use code blocks (```) to format console output,
logs, and code as it is tough to read otherwise.)
```
console/log/code output here
```

### Links/references

### Acceptance criteria
(Basically a "definition of done" with supporting evidence (job log excerpts,
screenshots, etc.) as appropriate.  Some people prefer to use checkboxes:
- [ ] first objective
- [ ] second objective
- [ ] (etc.)
and provide evidence in the issue comments instead of in this section.)
