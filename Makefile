# Goals, variables and macros that are about packaging the CDK, whether tarball, rpm, etc.
##### Set variables that affect the naming of the release packages
# The general package naming scheme is:
# <base>[-sw-platform][-<platform>]-<version>[-<release>][_<tag>][_J<job>][_<branch>][<dist>]
# where:
# <base> is our core package name: opencpi
# [-sw-platform] is omitted for development platforms
# [-<platform>] is the OpenCPI platform being distributed
#   Omitted in RPMs for dev platforms since it is redundant with the RPM suffix (e.g. el7.x86_64)
# <version> is our normally versioning scheme 1.2.3
# <release> is a label that defaults to "snapshot" if not overridden with OcpiRelease
#          Omitted for an actual official release
# These are only applied if not a specific versioned release:
# <tag> is a sequence number/timestamp within a release cycle (when not a specific release)
# <job> is a jenkins job reference if this process is run under Jenkins
# <branch> is a git branch reference if not "develop" or "undefined"
# <dist> added by RPM building, e.g. el7.x86_64
# And the appropriate suffix is added:  .rpm, or .tar.gz
base=opencpi
# cross: value is the target platform or null if not cross
# arg 1 is a single platform

# FIXME:automate this...

##### Set variables based on what git can tell us

# The BitBucket prefix of something like "bugfix--" is also stripped if present.

# Help

This top-level Makefile builds and/or tests the framework and built-in projects ($(Projects))

The valid goals that accept platforms (using RccPlatform(s) or Platforms(s)) are:
   Make goals for framework (core of Opencpi):
     framework(default) - Build the framework for platforms and export them
     cleanframework     - Clean the specific platforms
     exports            - Redo exports, including for indicated platforms
                        - This is cumulative;  previous exports are not removed
                        - This does not export projects or do exports for projects
     driver             - Build the driver(s) for the platform(s)
     testframework      - Test the framework, requires the projects be built
                        - Runs component unit tests in core project, but not in others
     cleandriver        - Clean the driver(s) for the platform(s)
     tar                - Create the tarball for the current cdk exports (exported platforms)
     rpm                - Create the binary/relocatable CDK RPM for the platforms
   Make goals for projects: (be selective using Projects=...)
     projects           - Build the projects for the platforms
     cleanprojects      - Clean all projects
     exportprojects     - Export all projects
   Other goals:
     clean              - clean framework and projects, respecting Platforms and Projects
     cleaneverything    - Clean as much as we can (framework and projects) without git cleaning
                        - also distclean does this for historical/compatible reasons
                        - ignores the Platform and Projects variables
     prerequisites      - Forces a (re)build of the prerequisites for the specified platforms.
                        - Downloads will be downloaded if they are not present already.
     cleanprerequisites - Clean out all built, downloaded prerequisites.

Variables that are useful for most goals:

Platforms/Platform/RccPlatforms/RccPlatform: all specify software platforms
  -- Useful for goals:  framework(default), exports, cleanframework, projects, exportprojects,
                        driver, cleandriver, prerequisites, tar, rpm
  -- Platforms can have build options/letters after a hyphen: d=dynamic, o=optimized
     <platform>:    default static, debug build
     <platform>-d:  dynamic library, debug build
     <platform>-o:  static library, optimized build
     <platform>-do: dynamic library, optimized build

Projects: specify projects (default is: $(Projects))
  -- Useful for goals:  projects, cleanprojects, exportprojects, testprojects

The projects for project-related goals use the Projects variable.
The default is all the built-in projects (including inactive) in order: $(Projects)
These various project-related goals simply perform the goal in all projects:
   rcc ocl hdl applications test run runtest hdlprimitives components
   cleanhdl cleanrcc cleanocl
Variables that only affect project building can also be used, like HdlPlatforms.
