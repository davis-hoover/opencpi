This script creates and fills a directory to be written to an SD card for OpenCPI on Zynq.
When the contents is written to an SD card, that card can be used as the boot disk on a
Zynq-based system.

It assumes:
1. You have created an OpenCPI Zynq release from Xilinx releases and kernel sources.
2. You have cross-built OpenCPI for the corresponding zynq software platform (version)
3. You have built the HDL assets for the particular zynq HDL platform.
4. You are running in the platforms/zynq directory or a specific software platform's directory.
5. You are running in the same directory where the release was created.

This script can be repeatedly run; it first clears out the directory it is filling.

This script takes three arguments to run:
1. the OpenCPI Zynq release name to use
2. the HDL platform name to use associated with the software platform you are enabling.
3. the Zynq software platform to use (which defaults to the name of the CWD)

Don't forget to copy zynq/default_mysetup.sh to mysetup.sh and customize mysetup.sh before
doing this.  Also, copy zynq/default_mynetsetup.sh to mynetsetup.sh and customize
mynetsetup.sh before doing this.

Also, artifacts for the SD card are found based on the OCPI_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable,
so make sure it includes the desired artifacts for running on the system you are targeting.

The result will be placed in a subdirectory of the release directory, called OpenCPI-SD, e.g.
opencpi-zynq-linux-release-<rel-name>/OpenCPI-SD.  You can further customize it if needed.
