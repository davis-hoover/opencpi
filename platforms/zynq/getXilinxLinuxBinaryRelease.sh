This script retrieves and unpacks a Xilinx Zynq Linux binary release.
You must navigate to the web site at http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/Zynq+Releases and
choose the release, and determine the download file name, usually by clicking right on the link
and copying it.  An example of a download link is:
http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/file/view/2013.4-release.tar.xz/483333010/2013.4-release.tar.xz
You should also record from the site, the git release tag associated with the binary release.
This should be consistent with the repo tag used in ./createLinuxKernelHeaders.sh.
It may also want to be consistent with the release of the installed Xilinx EDK.

This script takes 3 arguments:
1. The OpenCPI zynq release name you are creating (e.g. 13_4).
2. The download URL for the release (or the actual tarball filename)
3. Your working directory for downloaded xilinx content.
