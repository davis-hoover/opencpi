     * semaphore is an unsigned integer variable that can be atomically
     * incremented (using post()) and decremented (using wait()). If the
     * value of the integer is zero, a decrement operation will block
     * until another thread increments the semaphore.
     *
     * A single instance is shared between the threads that want to
     * synchronize.
