     * \brief Iterates over a list of files and subdirectories in a directory.
     *
     * Iterate over a list of file names in the file system that match a
     * "glob"-style pattern.  FileIterator instances can be constructed
     * manually, and are returned from the FileSystem::list() operation.
     *
     * The end() operation should be called after construction, before
     * calling any of the other operations (with the exception of close()),
     * to ensure that the list of files is not empty.  Otherwise, if there
     * were no matching files, the other operations would fail.
     *
     * The ordering of files and subdirectories is implementation dependent.
     *
     * \note On Windows, networked shares are not included when listing
     * files in the root directory.  The root directory of a networked
     * share can not be listed.  E.g., listing the directory "/ad-fpilhofe1"
     * will fail even though the host may export shares.
