Usage: $(basename $0) [-p PKG_ID [-u URL] [-g GIT_REV]] [--minimal] [--optimize] install platform <platform>

Download, build, and register the built-in or remote OpenCPI RCC or HDL platform.

Required args:
  <platform>                    name of platform to install

Optional args:
  The -u and -g flags are only valid if the -p flag is specified as well. If
  the PKG_ID has already been downloaded and is detected, then PKG_ID can be
  omitted and just <platform> is required.

  -p, --package-id=PKG_ID       OpenCPI package ID that provides <platform>
  -u, --url=URL                 the URL to use when cloning the remote or local
                                  git repo; default is determined by PKG_ID
  -g, --git-revision=GIT_REV    branch, tag, or other valid git revision to
                                  checkout after cloning the default git repo
                                  determined by PKG_ID; default value is the
                                  currently checked out OpenCPI git revision
  --minimal                     specifies a minimized installation process that
                                  does not pre-build HDL workers or run any
                                  installation tests; default is "false"
  --optimize                    for RCC (software) platforms only, specifies that
                                  the framework software and software workers be
                                  built w/optimization enabled; default is "false"

Examples:
  # xsim
  ocpiadmin install platform xsim

  # E31x
  ocpiadmin -p ocpi.osp.e3xx install platform e31x

  # PlutoSDR
  # PKG_ID not needed for second command as it has already been downloaded
