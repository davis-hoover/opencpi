# Project concept.
# While component libraries and primitive libraries (or cores) are each in their own
# world, and the HDL build process can provide lists of dependencies at each level,
# and now can also provide a search path for each to "find the library somewhere in this path",
# there is value in having a higher level *thing* that encompasses a package of
# open-cpi-related deliverables that you might depend on.
# Also, projects have both source and exported vertions, but we will only look for
# the expported stuff from projects
# The shape of a project is like the CDK.
#
# Component library place within an exported project/cdk: for lib xxx
#    binary:  lib/xxx (specs) and lib/xxx/hdl (workers)
# Primitive library place within an exported project/cdk
#    binary   lib/hdl/xxx/ttt


################################################################################
# Component Library searching
#  Component libraries are searched for 2 reasons:
#  1. To find the XML associated with HDL workers: to find if the worker is there at all,
#     and information about it, and its parameter/build configurations.
#  2. To find the binary artifact(s) for the worker for a given target family and 
#     parameter configuration
#
#  The ComponentLibraries user Makefile variable contains a list of libraries, with two types of
#  elements in the list:
#  1. names (no slashes anywhere),
#  2. paths (slashes).
#  For type 1 (names, no slashes), the name means:
#   Search for the named library in all places indicated in
#   OCPI_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_PATH (colon separated) and then look
#   for the named library in all the frameworks indicated in
#   OCPI_PROJECT_PATH (colon separated), then finally look in the framework at
#   OCPI_CDK_DIR.  Essentially the OCPI_CDK_DIR is always the last framework in the path.
#  This means that one name in the ComponentLibraries list
#   expands to a list of same-named libraries where earlier ones can
#   shadow later ones.
#  Rationale for OCPI_COMPONENT_LIBRARY_PATH:
#   allows for a place to contain a batch of libraries, without being a whole framework
#   allows complete ignorance of the notion of frameworks
#  Rational for OCPI_PROJECT_PATH
#   allows convenient use of the place for a batch of built stuff that is the same
#   structure as the delivered core (which may or may not have built FPGA stuff).
#  For type 2 (slashes, whether relative or absolute), this path simply means:
#   Search the library that lives at this path, whether a source library or an exported/installed
#   library.
#  This search structure supports shadowing (where earlier libraries in the path can supply
#  workers that also appear in later libraries).
#  Shadowing is simple-minded - you don't keep searching
#  past libraries that have the worker XML but aren't built for the target, or have the worker,
#  but not the desired parameter configuration.
#  
#  Pattern matching at targeted locations.
#  When a location is examined as a component library, it can be either a source component
#  library, where:
#   - the export subdirectory is called "lib" (where specs live), and
#   - lib/hdl subdirectory is where HDL worker XML and build files live, and 
#   - lib/hdl/<target> where target-specific built artifacts live.
#
#  Alternatively, when a library is exported, its directory (whose name is the library name),
#  acts the same as the "lib" subdirectory in the source library.  Thus in this case the
#  hdl and hdl/<target> diretories are used.
#
#  A final special case in ComponentLibraries is when the path contains target-% which indicates
#  a target-specific directory of a single worker.  This is mostly used internally, but can
#  be useful in very simple cases where there is no library - just a worker's directory by
#  itself.

# Return list of target directories in all possible component libraries
# For example, return a list of all component-library "target" directories.
#              Of the form: <library>/lib/hdl/<target>
# These locations are useful for locating HDL cores/workers

# Primitive Library searching (actually primitive library and/or core searching)
#  Primitive libraries are searched to find a (usually) precompiled library or core
#  when building higher level entities
#  Primitive libraries and cores (collectively: primitives) differ in that cores are incorporated
#  whole when used, whereas libraries are collections of modules that are only used and instanced
#  if iindividually instanced at a higher level.
#
#  The "Libraries" or "HdlLibraries" or "PrimitiveLibraries" variables provide a list of
#  libraries that should be available to the code at the level they are specified.
#  Similarly the "Cores" variable provides a list of primitive cores that should be available
#  for instantiation.
#
# These variables may be set in the appropriate Makefiles for workers (including device workers
#  and platform workers), and assemblies (application, platform configuration, and container).
#
# The Libraries and Cores variables are used like the ComponentLibraries variable
# to provide a list of either paths (with slashes) or names (without slashes).
# Similarly, the OCPI_HDL_PRIMITIVE_PATH is used to provide an ordered list of places to find
# the libraries and cores mentioned in the Libraries and Cores variable (those items without slashes).
