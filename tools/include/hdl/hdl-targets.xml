<!-- database of FPGA/HDL vendors, parts, tools etc. generally ordered alphabetically for humans
     dropped on conversion from hdl-target.mk: HdlSimTools

Notes regarding HdlTargets:

The *default* attribute for a family is the one used for core building (primitives, workers...).
If the default is unset, the first part in a family is the one used for core building.
Usually the default should be the smallest so that you ensure each worker will fit
on the smaller parts. If you want to ensure that worker-synthesis uses as many
resources as necessary, you can set it to a larger part or set HdlExactPart
for a worker or library.

The *part* attribute in the <platform>.xml file will define a full part. That part
can be mapped to a part here and therefore a family as well.
E.g. in zed.xml, part='xc7z020-1-clg484', which maps to xc7z020, which
maps to the 'zynq' family with a default target of xc7z020 for building pre-platform cores.
In OpenCPI parts are always three hypen-separated fields roughly meaning:
<die>-<speed_grade>-<package>
Since vendors name parts in a variety of ways, and change their minds about
part ordering formats, and use different formats between data sheets and tools,
there is a tool-specific make function, HdlFullPart_<tool> to translate between
our canonical form, and the format that the tools like, which is *not*
necessarily the "part ordering number" in data sheets etc.
