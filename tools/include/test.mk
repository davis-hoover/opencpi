# Help
define help
The make command is used with the following goals to invoke the phases:
  build — (the default goal if none is specified) build locally generated HDL
           assemblies, implies generate if needed
  run   — perform execution and verification, interleaved per subcase
  clean — clean all generated, built and execution directories and files

The following goals control the process at a finer granularity:
  generate     — perform all offline generation tasks: scripted input data and property
                 values, applications, HDL assemblies, generation report
  prepare      — discover platforms and artifacts and generate execution scripts per
                 platform, assumes required artifacts are built
  runnoprepare — execute tests assuming a previous prepare was done
  runonly      — prepare and execute tests, but do not perform any verification
  verify       — perform verification for whatever platforms have been executed
  view         — run the view scripts and put the results in separate windows
  cleanrun     — clean all run results
  cleansim     — clean all simulation output (but not run results)

The following variables can be set, usually on the command line:
  Verbose              - set to 1 for putting the execution logs on the console
  TestAccumulateErrors - set to 1 to continue after errors until all platforms/cases are done
  Cases                - set to specific cases, including wildcards for execute and/or verify
  KeepSimulations      - set to 1 to preserve simulation outputs rather than delete on success
  TestTimeout          - set to number of seconds to limit execution for any case
  OnlyPlatforms        - set to platforms to run tests on, rather than those available
  View                 - set to 1 to enable the "view" script during verify
  TestApplications     - set to C++ programs to build (set only in the Makefile)
