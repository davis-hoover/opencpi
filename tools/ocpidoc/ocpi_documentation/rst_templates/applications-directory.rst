.. Make sure that any subsidiary files that are included into an asset document,
   whether or not they are local, are named with the suffix .inc, not .rst.
   Using the .inc suffix for subsidiary included files is currently necessary
   to prevent them from being mistakenly generated by the asset documentation
   system during a documentation build operation.
   
.. The search path "*/*-application" is for backward compatibility with older
   application document naming schemes.
