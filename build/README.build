This directory is for the build machinery for building the OpenCPI framework libraries and
executables.

We try to separate concerns of:

1. The description of OpenCPI software and platforms that does not say how it is built.
2. The build mechanisms used to actually build it.

Furthermore we want to enable the possibility of multiple instances of #2 (e.g. autotools,
cmake, scons) so that it is relatively easy to change and evolve.

The files in this directory are of type #1:

README.build - this file
places - a list of framework source directories and their attributes, one per line
         see the comments in that file for its format and syntax

Also, key files used when building the framework for various platforms:

../tools/include/platform-defaults.mk
       - the file that defines the default values for software platform definitions.
(any-project)/rcc/platforms/<platform>/<platform>.mk
       - the file that defines a particular software platform

In addition to these files are directories containing build mechanisms, (type #2)
the first being "autotools".  In the autotools directory, files described above are used
to build the framework using autotools.
