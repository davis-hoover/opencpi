# This Makefile is used narrowly for the autotools-based reconf/configure/build process.
# It shows the explicit dependencies for the bootstrapping process
# The only dependencies it does not track are additions to the imported-macros and our-macros
# directories, but it does depend on the mod date of those directories so additions are tracked.
# Thus this file basically implements a "bootstrap.sh" or "reconf" using "make".
# It does rely on autoreconf knowing autotools dependencies
#
# There are three phases to this build/configure process
# The first and its clean goal are platform agnostic
# After the first, the Platform(s) variable indicates platforms and build options
# The default is the current platform of course.
#
# 1. preconfigure goal, which creates a configurable platform-agnostic package:
#    It is a wrapper around the typical autotools "autoreconf"
#    It is invoked by "make preconfigure" and cleaned by "make cleanpreconfigure"
#    It is NOT platform-specific - it prepares the tree to build for all platforms
#    Its dependencies that are authored are:
#      -- The "places" file describing OpenCPI source directories
#      -- The generate-automake.sh script that generates the Makefile.am file
#      -- The configure.ac script
#    It also depends on the autoconf macros in the imported-macros and our-macros
#    subdirectories.  All results are in the "gen" subdirectory.
#
# 2. configuration for a platform:
#    It is a wrapper around the typical autotools "configure"
#    It is invoked by "make configure [Platform[s]=<platform>...]", cleaned by "cleanconfigure"
#    It defaults to the currently running platform with default build options
#    It imports platform information from OpenCPI <platform>.mk files from projects/rcc/platforms
#    It runs configure in "VPATH" mode to keep build trees separate from source trees
#
# 3. build for a platform
#    It is a convenience for "go into the platform's build dir and make"
#    It is invoked by "make build [Platform=<platform>]"
#    Thus it simply does "make -C target-<platform>"
#    Cleaning is a specific platform is "make -C target-<platform> clean"
#
# 4. install for a platform
#    It is a convenience for "go into the platform's build dir and 'make install' there"
#    This is just a local "finalize what you built" step and doesn't install anything elsewhere
#    The results are in the target-<platform>/staging directory.

# The results of the per-platform configure process are entirely in directories
# named: target-<platform> (including build option suffix)

# For predictability for now we force OCPI_CDK_DIR to be the ../../bootstrap directory since this
# will make it very clear what is needed for the framework to build from scratch
# We depend on access to the project that has the RCC platform we are building, either as a
# registered project or in OCPI_PROJECT_PATH.

# We try hard to not rely on all the scripts in the CDK, at the expense of a little
# redundancy in platform handling, but this keeps the dependencies manageable.

	@echo 2. Those that do things for a particular software platform.
	@echo
	@echo The platform agnostic ones are, in order of typical use:
	@echo
	@echo   make cleaneverything'    #' make sure everything is as clean as it can be
	@echo   make preconfigure'       #' do one-time work for all platforms, using autoreconf
