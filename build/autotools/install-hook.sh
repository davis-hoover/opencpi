# This script is run in the automake install-data-hook.
# It cannot run in the install-exec-hook since that is too early.
# It is cleaner to write it in a bash script than in a make recipe.
# It is run in the "$DESTDIR/$prefix" directory
# It is passed in a bunch of information so that it is not dependent on or dragging in any
# other configuration information.
# Args are:
# 1: dynamic suffix (including period)
# 2: ocpi_dynamic (0 or 1)
# 3: platform target string
# 4: host platform
# 5: drivers
# 6: swigs
# 7: prereqs
# 8: prereqs dir
# Environment variables are:
# V for automake 0 for quiet, 1 for verbose
#
# We use this hook to "post process" the installation staging directory $(DESTDIR) and do things
# that libtool cannot do due to its broad historical portability mandates (being nice here)
# The actions taken are:
# 0. Remove libtool relics, leaving only real libraries that we need
# 1. On static builds:
#    -- remove DT_NEEDEDs from plugin/driver libraries that reference our libs or prereqs
#    -- remove dynamic libraries that were only built for error checking (e.g. stubs).
#    The only dynamic libraries left are:
#    - driver libraries with no DT_NEEDED entries
#    - swig libraries with no-DT_NEEDED except for dynamic prereqs
# 2. On dynamic builds: for all dynamic libraries and executables:
#    -- change DT_NEEDEDs to not be absolute
#    -- use rpath $ORIGIN/../lib (or mac equivalent)

# For now we have "linux with ELF" and "mac" modes so its easy enough switch here,
# but there may be a more comprehensive solution it we get more variations.
