This directory contains code that implements objects that are the runtime behavior
of things that have XML.

It parses (imports) them and sometimes serializes (unparses, exports to text) them.

Basically anything found in XML that is processed at runtime and needs a class for
runtime behavior will have that class implemented here.

Current examples are assemblies, workers, ports, protocols.

XMl is used to provide a structured, hierarchical textual representation, and alternatives
such as YAML would serve the same purposes.
