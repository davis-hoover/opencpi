This directory contains code that implements objects that are the runtime behavior of XML objects.
It parses them and sometimes serializes them (writes out XML from data structure/objects).
Basically anything found in XML that is processed at runtime and needs a runtime class for
runtime behavior will have that class implemented here except data type XML which is at a lower level.

Current examples are assemblies, workers, ports, protocols.

XMl is used to provide a structured, hierarchical textual representation, and alternatives
such as YAML would serve the same purposes.

The assembly class is the runtime or tooltime parsing class to manage assemblies for
various purposes.  In general, an assembly has instances of workers or components,
with per-instance properties,  connections between the ports of the instances, and
external connections that externalize ports of instances.
