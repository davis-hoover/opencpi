  Generic Ethernet L2 "discovery" etc.
  We define L2 Ethernet discovery as sending a broadcast packet with a defined ethertype and payload,
  and receiving one or more responses back of the same ethertype, and with a payload.
  This the "found" callback is the "name" (including mac address) and response payload.
  Thus this module knows about ethernet, but not about the details of discovery payloads.
