This library provides user mode virtual file service access to several underlying file technologies, including

-- actual local operating system file system calls
-- as http client
-- using URI
-- using a stream'd VFS to extract files from
-- using a ZIP file
-- using a ZIP'd stream
-- using simple chunks of memory as a file contents
-- using a "filter" for allowable file names in an underlying VFS
-- using a "readonly" filter for an underlying file system


Several utility functions are also provided for files accessed using this VFS interface.

-- md5 hash of a file
-- checking if the file is an XML document
-- recursive file and directory copy and remove
-- module loading from a VFS

This was originally created to meet the SCA requirement for user-mode file access.
It is not currently (2.3) used anywhere in OpenCPI.
