This library/layer contains core infrastructure modules for OpenCPI that are widely used and
widely depended on by all upper layers of OpenCPI.
The functionality is fairly unique to OpenCPI and is thus not part of the more
utilitarian libraries and layers below here.

The layers below this one contain OS abstraction, imported/foreign code, and
code that provides broadly common utility functions.

So code that is very generic should probably go in the util layer below this, while
code that should be considered OpenCPI core infrastructure should be here.

Functionality found here includes code for:

- The plugin system (user mode drivers loaded as needed etc.)
- Managing data types for properties, protocols, command options, and PValues.
- Data-typed runtime values (the Value class)
- Variable length, data typed, function/method arguments (the PValue class)
- Artifact files that contain embedded XML metadata to descrive what is inside them

Basically these are functionalitiess that are not really big enough to deserve their own library.
