This library/layer contains infrastructure modules for OpenCPI that are widely used and
widely depended on by all upper layers of OpenCPI.
The functionality is fairly unique to OpenCPI and is thus not part of the more
utilitarian librarys and layers below here.

The layers below this one contain OS abstraction, imported/foreign code, and
core that provides broadly common utility functions.

So code that is very generic should probably go in the util layer below this, while
code that should be considered OpenCPI infrastructure should be here.
