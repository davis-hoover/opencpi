This directory holds runtime C++ software for OpenCPI (and some foreign C code that is not C++)
This is the software that is required to run applications.
Some of the code here is also used by some development tools that do not really operate in the runtime environment.
I.e. if software is used by both runtime and tools, it is considered runtime software since the runtime
software has more constraints than tool software (i.e. it must run on embedded systems and many compilers).

The runtime software here relies the OpenCPI os abstraction layer in ../os.
It also relies on calls to some (runtime, cross-compiled) prerequisite software libraries like gpsd amd lzma,
as well as standard C++ libraries, and OS system libraries and system calls.

Thus the runtime stack of software is typically layered (higher levels can use lower levels, but NOT vice versa).

The actual ordering or layering is defined in the ../build/places file.
