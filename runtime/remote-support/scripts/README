These scripts support remote management of an OpenCPI container server.
The fundamental executable is ocpiserve, which serves up containers for use by clients running applications.

The two scripts here provide a layar of management on top of ocpiserve.

The primary requirements are:

1.  Minimize assumptions and requirements and dependencies and setup on the server machine itself.
    !!No software installation is required.!!
    Current requirements are ssh server, bash and tar and nothing else.

2.  Operate/install/use the server in a sandbox that has no impact on any installed software,
    opencpi or otherwise.  The only assumption is that no one else is using it (for now).

I.e.: take a bare machine with software platform supported by OpenCPI that has ssh/bash/tar, and use it
without installing anything.

The two scripts are:

ocpiremote - the client for controlling the server
  (there is a ocpiremote C++ main program too - it is a placeholder, but it may not be necessary if
   the bash script is ok, but the argument parsing should be our standard options).

ocpi_server.sh - the server script for ocpiremote - not a persistent server
  (maybe a better name:  the "control/admin server script" ocpi_server_admin

ocpiremote has the typical:
  <program> <options> <verbs>

syntax like ocpihdl ocpidev etc.

But it can take multiple verbs and executes them in sequence.

TODOs:

Eventually like all tools, have a standardized way to set options in environment variables.
Ensure private key password-less usage.
Protection for multiple clients colliding
Any manipulation of the server for multi-cast discovery
